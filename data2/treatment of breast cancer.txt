Treatment of Breast Cancer
Understanding breast cancer treatment options can help family physicians care for their patients during and after
cancer treatment. This article reviews typical treatments based on stage, histology, and biomarkers. Lobular carcinoma in situ does not require treatment. Ductal carcinoma in situ can progress to invasive cancer and is treated with
breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy without further lymph node exploration or systemic therapy. Stages
I and II breast cancers are usually treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy
following breast-conserving surgery decreases mortality and recurrence. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered for
most breast cancers with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, and it does not have the adverse effects of arm swelling and pain that are associated with axillary lymph node dissection. Choice of adjuvant systemic therapy depends
on lymph node involvement, hormone receptor status, ERBB2 (formerly HER2 or HER2/neu) overexpression, and
patient age and menopausal status. In general, node-positive breast
cancer is treated systemically with chemotherapy, endocrine therapy
(for hormone receptor–positive cancer), and trastuzumab (for cancer overexpressing ERBB2). Anthracycline- and taxane-containing
chemotherapeutic regimens are active against breast cancer. Stage III
breast cancer typically requires induction chemotherapy to downsize the tumor to facilitate breast-conserving surgery. Inflammatory
breast cancer, although considered stage III, is aggressive and requires
induction chemotherapy followed by mastectomy, rather than breastconserving surgery, as well as axillary lymph node dissection and
chest wall radiation. Prognosis is poor in women with recurrent or
metastatic (stage IV) breast cancer, and treatment options must balance benefits in length of life and reduced pain against harms from
treatment. (Am Fam Physician. 2010;81(11):1339-1346. Copyright ©

options by cancer stage and type.6-22
Stage 0: In Situ
Lobular carcinoma in situ is an incidental microscopic finding of abnormal tissue
growth in the lobules of the breast. It does
not progress to, but increases the risk of,
subsequent invasive breast cancer in either
breast by approximately 7 percent over
10 years.23 Local and systemic therapies are
not indicated, but affected women should
undergo rigorous breast cancer surveillance.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends annual mammography
and clinical breast examination every six
months.24 Patients should be offered information about chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs),
such as tamoxifen.6

Conversely, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can progress to invasive breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery
followed by radiation therapy is standard treatment for
DCIS; however, mastectomy may be recommended for
extensive or multifocal disease. Pathologic lymph node
evaluation is not usually performed because nodal
metastasis is rare. There is conflicting evidence regarding endocrine therapy with tamoxifen in women with
DCIS.25,26 Given the risks of tamoxifen and the low risk of
recurrence of DCIS, routine use of tamoxifen in women
with DCIS is not recommended.

The status of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) determines
the need for radiation therapy and adjuvant systemic
therapy. ALN dissection at the time of surgery was standard care until the 1990s, but often resulted in pain,
numbness, swelling, and decreased mobility in the
affected arm. In patients with clinically negative nodes,
a negative intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN)
biopsy precludes the need for ALN dissection.

Table 1. Breast Cancer Five-Year Survival
by Stage at Diagnosis

Stages I and II: Early-Stage Invasive
SURGERY

Modified radical mastectomy has traditionally been
the standard of care for early-stage invasive breast cancers. However, breast-conserving surgery has been
favored more recently. This therapy involves removing the tumor without removing excess healthy breast
tissue, with the outcome of a breast that is more aesthetically acceptable to the patient than the outcome
from radical mastectomy. Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery decreases local recurrence and improves cancer-specific survival rates to
rates equivalent to those with mastectomy.8 Breastconserving surgery has the highest success rate in women
with early-stage breast cancer, but it is not recommended
for women at high risk of local recurrence.27 Table 3 lists
qualifications for consideration of breast-conserving
surgery.7 Women with early-stage breast cancer may opt
for mastectomy because of contraindications to radiation therapy or because of personal preference.

Table 3. Qualifying Factors for Consideration of BreastConserving Surgery in the Treatment of Breast Cancer

Radiation Therapy
Typically, whole-breast radiation is performed following breast-conserving surgery
to treat subclinical disease. A review of 10
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing breast-conserving surgery with and
without radiation showed that radiation in
addition to surgery significantly reduced
the five-year local recurrence rate, regardless of the use of adjuvant systemic therapy
(7 versus 26 percent; number needed to
treat [NNT] = 5), and appeared to decrease
the 15-year breast cancer mortality risk
(30.5 versus 35.9 percent; NNT = 18).8
According to a systematic review of three
RCTs, the sequencing of chemotherapy and
radiation therapy does not appear to have
a major effect on survival or recurrence
as long as radiation is commenced within
seven months of surgery.33 Radiation therapy is expensive and time-consuming, and
shorter therapies can be appealing. Five-year
results appear favorable in studies evaluating brachytherapy and compressed schedules of radiation; however, long-term data
are lacking.34,35

Negative surgical margins
No diffuse (inflammatory) or multicentric cancer
No malignant-appearing mammographic abnormality after surgery
No previous radiation therapy to the breast or chest wall (precludes further

surgery (relative contraindication).

Most women with early-stage breast cancer
receive adjuvant systemic therapies. Chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and tissuetargeted therapies enhance definitive local
therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, or both),
substantially decreasing cancer recurrence
and disease-specific death. Node-positive
disease benefits most from systemic therapy.

Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the standard of care for women with node-positive
cancer or with a tumor larger than 1 cm.
Hormone receptor–negative disease derives
more benefit from chemotherapy than hormone receptor–positive disease.47 Factors
such as age and comorbidities also influence the decision to use chemotherapy. Most
studies suggest a small benefit for treatment
with anthracyclines or taxanes over other
chemotherapies,12 particularly in women
with tumors overexpressing ERBB2.48 A systematic review of 12 studies demonstrated

disease-free and overall survival advantages when using a
taxane-containing regimen for premenopausal and postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.49 A
meta-analysis of 13 RCTs determined that adding a taxane
to an anthracycline-based regimen improved disease-free
survival (five-year risk reduction = 5 percent) and overall
survival (five-year risk reduction = 3 percent).50
Endocrine Therapy. Endocrine therapies, such as
SERMs, aromatase inhibitors, and gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists, prevent estrogen production
or block estrogen, thereby preventing stimulation of an
estrogen-sensitive tumor. In premenopausal women,
ovarian ablation or oophorectomy may be considered.
Endocrine therapy is not effective against cancers that are
lacking hormone receptors. Five years of treatment with
tamoxifen reduces the breast cancer death rate (absolute
risk reduction = 9.2 percent over 15 years; NNT = 11).12
Aromatase inhibitors should be considered in all postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive
breast cancer. They block the conversion of androgens to
estrogen in postmenopausal women. Trials consistently
show that aromatase inhibitors reduce the risk of relapse
of early-stage breast cancer both in direct comparison
with and after completion of tamoxifen.36,38,51,52 A large
RCT showed that treatment with letrozole (Femara) following five years of treatment with tamoxifen decreased
the incidence of contralateral breast cancer and improved
disease-specific survival in patients who were node
positive.53 None of these studies showed improvement
in overall survival compared with tamoxifen.36,38,51-53
Many women tolerate aromatase inhibitors better than
tamoxifen.40 Aromatase inhibitors are not indicated for
premenopausal women.
Tissue-Targeted Therapy. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of early-stage breast cancers overexpress ERBB2.44,45
These cancers generally have a worse prognosis. A
humanized anti-ERBB2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), improves disease-specific and overall survival when added to anthracyclines and paclitaxel
(Taxol) chemotherapy in women with node-positive and
high-risk, node-negative breast cancers overexpressing ERBB2.13,14 The combination of trastuzumab and
anthracyclines must be used with caution, however,
because cardiac toxicity will develop in 2 to 3 percent of
patients over two years of treatment.
Stage III: Locally Advanced
Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) includes tumors
larger than 5 cm, extensive regional lymph node involvement, direct involvement of underlying chest wall or
skin, tumors considered inoperable but without distant

metastases, and inflammatory breast cancer. Induction chemotherapy followed by local therapy (surgery,
radiation therapy, or both) is becoming the standard of
care. Five-year survival can be achieved in 55 percent
of patients presenting with noninflammatory LABC.54
The most important prognostic factors are response to
induction chemotherapy and lymph node status.
INDUCTION SYSTEMIC THERAPIES

Induction Chemotherapy. Patients with LABC who
achieve an excellent response to induction chemotherapy
have outcomes similar to those in patients with earlystage disease.15 Preoperative chemotherapy downsizes
the local tumor, facilitating breast-conserving surgery.
With induction chemotherapy, 75 percent of patients
have a reduction in tumor size greater than 50 percent.21
Preoperative chemotherapy increases breast conservation rates, but also increases the rate of local recurrence.
However, local recurrence is not increased as long as surgery remains part of the treatment, even after complete
tumor regression.21
Mastectomy may

or based on patient
preference.
Induction Endocrine Therapy. Induction endocrine
therapy (tamoxifen with or without aromatase inhibitors) is less effective than chemotherapy and may be
most appropriate for older patients not willing to accept
chemotherapy-related toxicity. Patients with hormone
receptor–positive LABC are generally best served by
combined induction chemotherapy and endocrine therapy following surgery.
Induction Tissue-Targeted Therapy. There are few solid
data about the use of tissue-targeted therapy (trastuzumab) as induction therapy. Because of the benefit of
adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy in earlystage breast cancer, 12 months of postoperative trastuzumab is recommended for patients who have LABC
with ERBB2 overexpression.
LOCAL THERAPY

Tumor response to induction chemotherapy determines
local therapy, such as surgery (mastectomy or breastconserving surgery), radiation therapy, or both. Data
from uncontrolled prospective studies indicate that
50 to 90 percent of women with LABC can be successfully treated with breast-conserving surgery after

Breast Cancer

induction chemotherapy, although no RCTs have been
completed on this topic.17,18 In patients whose cancer
does not respond to induction chemotherapy, surgery is
appropriate only if a complete resection can be attained.
Extensive lymph node involvement (i.e., more than
three axillary, internal mammary, or clavicular nodes),
residual pathologic tumors larger than 2 cm, multifocal
residual disease, and lymphovascular invasion increase
the rate of local recurrence following breast-conserving
surgery after induction chemotherapy and, therefore,
warrant mastectomy.19
Most patients presenting with LABC have clinically
positive lymph nodes and require ALN dissection. In
patients with LABC and clinically negative nodes, SLN
biopsy following induction chemotherapy has been
shown to have a similar detection rate as in early-stage
breast cancer without induction chemotherapy.20 Even
in patients who have clinically complete remission with
induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy following
surgery decreases the local recurrence rate.55

be used in combination with endocrine therapy for susceptible tumors.

Inflammatory breast cancer is relatively rare and is
characterized by diffuse erythema and edema (peau
d’orange), no palpable mass, early age at diagnosis, poor
nuclear grade, negative hormone–receptor status, and
poor survival outcome. Management is similar to that of
noninflammatory LABC; however, because of the aggressiveness of inflammatory breast cancer, SLN biopsy and
breast-conserving surgery are not recommended. After
induction chemotherapy, patients are usually treated
with mastectomy followed by chest wall radiation.

Recurrent Breast Cancer
Following initial treatment, breast cancer can recur
locally, regionally (nodes), or at distant metastatic sites.
Approximately 11 and 20 percent of patients treated
with adjuvant therapies develop locoregional recurrence
within five and 10 years, respectively.56 Locoregional
recurrence is an indicator of an aggressive tumor, and
early recurrence carries a poor prognosis.57 Recurrence
without clinical metastases has a five-year survival of
approximately 40 percent.22 Mastectomy is indicated for
in-breast tumor recurrence after breast-conserving surgery, followed by repeat axillary staging. SLN biopsy is
thought to be acceptable if lymph nodes were not removed
initially and if there is no clinical evidence of lymph node
involvement, although RCTs are lacking.58,59
Wide local excision of the recurrent tumor is recommended for an isolated chest wall recurrence. If unresectable, induction chemotherapy may facilitate successful
local treatment. If there is evidence of axillary involvement without distant metastases, axillary evaluation is
recommended. Radiation therapy is recommended only
in the setting of inoperable or incompletely resected
recurrent disease. The benefit of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for patients with recurrence is uncertain,60
and a large randomized trial is underway.61 Until results
are available, chemotherapy is recommended for recurrent cancer; endocrine therapy is recommend for hormone receptor–positive cancer; and trastuzumab is
recommended for tumors overexpressing ERBB2.

Stage IV: Metastatic
Some women, including those who relapse after treatment
of early-stage breast cancer or LABC, will present with
metastatic disease. Five-year survival is attained in only
23.3 percent of these patients3; therefore, it is important to
understand the patient’s treatment goals.
Radiation therapy or bisphosphonates, along with
endocrine therapy or chemotherapy, can palliate pain
from bony complications. Systemic treatment depends
on hormone receptor status, rate of disease progression, and patient willingness to tolerate adverse effects
of treatment. Endocrine therapy is generally better
tolerated than chemotherapy. In women with rapidly progressive disease, it may be better to treat with
chemotherapy, which is more likely to induce a timely
response. Trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy
is a reasonable choice for the initial treatment of metastatic disease overexpressing ERBB2. Trastuzumab can

New and Upcoming Treatment Options
With the development of gene sequencing, targeted
therapies, and molecular diagnostics, breast cancer
treatment has the potential to become directed toward
each patient’s specific tumor characteristics. Estrogen
and progesterone receptors are already used to predict
a tumor’s response to hormone therapy (an example of
a prediction of adjuvant therapy benefit is available at
http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content-nw/full/337/jul11_2/
a540/FIG3), and ERBB2 expression predicts response to
treatment with trastuzumab.
Urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 are new prognostic markers. Newly
diagnosed breast cancer with low concentrations of these
markers has such a low risk of recurrence—especially in
patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy—that chemotherapy
may provide only minimal benefits.62
