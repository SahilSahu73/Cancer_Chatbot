FOREWORD
Despite remarkable advances in our understanding of the biology of breast cancer
and better therapeutic options available in the last decades, this malignant neoplasia continues to be of major public health concern around the globe. In 2020,
2.3 million females were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, with an
­incidence and related mortality that continue to grow globally. However, trends
and patterns vary in different countries as a result of differences in risk factors,
screening strategies, and access to newer therapies, among others. In the last
decades, many immunohistochemical markers (e.g., ER, PR, HER2, proliferation
maker Ki-67), genomic markers (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2), and immunologic markers
(e.g., immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) have been identified as molecular hallmarks of breast cancer, which are
currently used to stratify patients more accurately and provide them with a range
of treatment options, including novel targeted therapies.
In this book, a wide spectrum of topics that comprise clinically and biologically relevant aspects of breast cancer is covered. The first chapters provide an
up-to-date overview of epidemiological and etiological aspects of the disease, and
a concise pathologic description of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.
Innovations and specialized techniques in surgery, which plays a primary role in
the treatment of breast cancer, are then outlined, as well as non-invasive methods
used to assess lymphedema, a side effect seen in some patients after surgical or
radiation treatment. Since therapies currently used to treat metastatic breast cancer can extend survival and quality of life of patients but are not curative, a better
understanding of the mechanisms involved in metastatic dissemination is of pivotal importance; here, the role played by platelets and galectins in that process is
described. In the search of novel potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer,
different molecules, processes, and approaches are being explored at the bench. In
this regard, different chapters of the book describe novel research in a ubiquitinspecific protease (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18), the ribosomal protein S6
kinase 1 (RPS6K1), the lysosomal system, as well as the use of specific nanoparticles and proteolysis-target chimeras as potential therapeutic agents for breast
cancer.
The editor of Breast Cancer has brought together contributors across a full
range of clinical and translational research to produce a book that gives the reader
an overview of several important aspects of breast cancer that may be of interest
to healthcare professionals interested in this important medical topic.

Preface

PREFACE
This book provides a unique blend of carefully presented and structured information covering a broad array of relevant breast cancer related issues. The first eight
chapters cover breast cancer epidemiology, etiology, breast cancer subtypes, current and emerging surgical innovations to treat and image breast cancer, a description of noninvasive lymphedema assessment methods to detect and track this
important treatment complication and the potential role of platelets and galectins
in breast cancer metastasis. The last five chapters are devoted to the description of
forward-looking albeit potential breast cancer treatment possibilities.
Breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, surpassing lung
and prostate cancers. Part of this increase may be attributed to improved detection
but may also be due to changes in female fertility patterns along with lifestyle
changes. Although developed countries have the highest incidence of breast
­cancer the mortality rates vary widely from global region to region but are highest
in socio-economically low areas. However even in developed countries, there
appears to be a disproportionately higher mortality rate among black women
than white. Chapter 1 delves deeply into these and other issues from a global
perspective.
The etiology of breast cancer is attributed to a complex interaction between
various modifiable and non-modifiable factors that is determined by genetics,
environmental, nutritional, hormonal, and heritable elements. Risk factors include
prior history of breast cancer, positive family history, obesity, tall stature, smoking,
alcohol consumption, early menarche, late menopause, sedentary lifestyle, nulliparity and hormone replacement therapy. Factors associated with decreased risk
of breast cancer include multiparity, history of breastfeeding, physical activity,
weight loss, and prophylactic surgical and medical interventions. Chapter 2 provides a targeted overview of these issues with a further description of breast cancer
subtypes in chapter 3.
With the use of standardized staging and data collection, evidence-based management of breast cancer has evolved to limit treatments to what is necessary but
sufficient to allow tissue preservation and control of treatment-specific morbidity.
Surgery is an important component in the management of treatable breast cancer
and in chapter 4 innovative surgical approaches that focus on tissue preservation,
restoration of physical function and appearance are presented and discussed.
Breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a dreaded complication that presents as swelling in the arm, hand, trunk, or breast at varying times
after completion of breast cancer treatment. The incidence of BCRL varies widely
depending on the type and extent of the treatment, pre-treatment risk factors, and
the criteria used to define its presence. Of clinical importance are the various
quantitative measures used to specify lymphedema thresholds for its detection
and tracking over time and during treatment. Chapter 5 discusses these issues and
describes available non-invasive quantitative assessment methods with breast
imaging methods discussed in chapter 6.
Because metastasis is a major determinant of breast cancer related mortality,
factors that influence this process are exceedingly important. In chapter 7 the

roles of platelets in this process and current research regarding their potential as a
breast cancer therapeutic target are extensively described. Galectins that are
expressed in all breast cancer types are discussed in terms of their involvement in
the breast cancer metastasis process are discussed in chapter 8.
In the remaining chapters novel and evolving potential therapeutic modalities
are described based on their molecular properties and perceived therapeutic
potential. The molecular features of the multifunctional protein ubiquitin-specific
peptidase and its role in breast cancer are presented in chapter 9. Chapter 10
offers a discussion of the potential role of carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene,
fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nano diamonds, and carbon dots for breast cancer
treatment. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) as a potential therapeutic
target for breast cancer is discussed in chapter 11. The potential for proteolysistargeting chimeras (PROTACs) to diminish the pro-tumor activity of estrogen
receptor-alpha-positive is discussed in chapter 12. The final chapter discusses
lysosome properties, its role as a cellular death mediator and considers the possibility of lysosomes as a useful anti-cancer target.

Abstract: As of 2020, breast cancer has become the most diagnosed cancer globally, overtaking lung and prostate cancers. Breast cancer incidence is increasing
globally with cases in the United States expected to reach 364,000 in the year
2040. Part of this increase may be attributed to improved detection but some,
especially in lower developed countries, may be due to changes in female fertility
patterns along with lifestyle changes. Developed countries have the highest
­incidence of breast cancer. Mortality rates vary widely from global region to region
but are highest in socio-economically low areas, reflecting a lack of access to
early screening and timely treatment. Even in developed countries, the disproportionately high mortality rate among black women and white women further
underscores existing health inequality. This chapter aims to provide a global
­epidemiological overview of breast cancer incidence and mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) incidence is measured by the number of new cases that occur
within a population over a fixed time interval whereas its incidence rate is measured by the number of new cases within that interval divided by the number of
persons at risk for BC during that time interval (1). Comparing cancer incidence
rates may lead to a better understanding of cancer risk factors, facilitate the planning and prioritization of cancer control initiatives, and help evaluate specific
primary prevention programs. However, both indices are used in the literature
and herein will be cited accordingly. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR)
is used to compare populations that have different age profiles. It is determined by
dividing the incidence rate by the respective population in that age group and
multiplying the result by 100,000 (2). The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR)
is calculated similarly (2).
The incidence of BC has been growing by amounts that depend in part on a
country’s developmental index and the availability and utilization of BC screening methods such as self-breast examinations and mammography (3–6). Since
1997, high developmental index countries that include the United States, Europe,
and Oceania, have had an annual BC incidence rate increase of less than 0.5%
(4, 5). During the same time frame middle and low human development index
regions such as South America and Africa have had a greater rate of increase (7).
Asian countries, including Korea and Japan, although considered to have a high
human development index have also seen a rapid incidence rate increase (3).
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the human development
index is measured by a country’s accomplishments in three essential dimensions:
health as measured by life expectancy at birth, knowledge as measured by mean
and anticipated years of schooling and standard of living or quality of life as measured by gross national income (8).
During this same time interval, sub-Saharan African countries such as Nigeria,
Malawi, and Seychelles have experienced the highest BC incidence rate increase
of greater than 5% per year (6). Newly diagnosed BC cases have also risen in the
Eastern Cape of South Africa and Zimbabwe by 3–4% annually (6). These
increases are likely due to a combination of factors including the adaptation of
the westernized lifestyle, delaying the onset of childbearing, shortening the
breastfeeding period, and increasing the use of oral contraceptives that all contribute to BC development (2).
Studies conducted in Ireland, Denmark, Scotland, and the United States indicate an increase in the diagnosis of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BC and a
decrease in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) BC mainly reported in westernized
countries (9–13). The change has been partially attributed to increased incidence
of obesity with its associated higher body fat and greater androgen to estrogen
conversion in adipose tissue. This combination is associated with an increased
lifetime exposure to estrogen in women (7, 14–17). Higher and longer oral contraceptive use also contributes to this finding (18–21).
Countries with low and medium human development indexes also have been
experiencing increases in cancer risk factors such as smoking, bad eating habits,
excess body weight, and physical inactivity already present in high-income western countries (22). Since 2020, BC is the most diagnosed cancer globally except

Breast Cancer Epidemiology

for skin cancers (23). In 2020, BC accounted for nearly 12% of all new cancer
cases diagnosed in 7.8 million women worldwide (7, 23). The ASIR was highest
in countries with a very high human development index (75.6 cases/100,000) (19).
However, medium and low human development index countries had an ASIR of
27.8 cases /100,000 and 36.1 cases/100,000, respectively (19). As shown by the
ASIR values in Figure 1, Belgium (13.2 cases/100,000), The Netherlands (100.9
cases/100,000), Luxembourg (99.8 cases/100,000), and France (90.1
cases/100,000) had the highest BC incidence rates in 2020 (7). The four countries with the lowest incidence were Nepal (13.9 cases/100,000), Mongolia (11.1
cases/100,000), The Republic of the Gambia (11 cases/100,000), and Bhutan
(5.0 cases/100,000) (7). Overall, the incidence of breast cancer has doubled in
the last few decades in 60/102 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, and
Afghanistan (19).
Early detection of BC is inversely proportional to BC mortality; thus, screening
and increased individual awareness of BC leads to better outcomes (3). In recent
years, advances in BC therapy have contributed significantly to increased survival
and the subsequent reduction or stabilization of BC death rates in high to mediumresource regions (3). Since the introduction of mammography in 1976 and organized breast cancer screening guidelines in regions with high human development

index, a significant increase in early-stage BC diagnosis have led to a significant
decline in BC-related mortality (3).
Nevertheless, recently BC has become the fifth leading cause of mortality and
the leading cause of death from cancer among women worldwide (7). BC
accounted for 6.9% of all cancer-related deaths globally in 2020 (7). One in 6
cancer-related deaths is due to BC, making BC the leading cause of cancer
mortality in 110 countries (6). Australia/New Zealand, Northern Europe, North
America, and China are the exception, where BC is preceded by lung cancer, and
in sub-Saharan Africa, where cervical cancer mortality is highest (7). In the developing world, women have a 17% higher BC mortality rate (2) due to a lack of
defined early screening standards and poor or delayed access to treatment (18–21).
Asia and Africa shared 63% of the 685,000 BC-related deaths in 2020, with China
being the highest at 82,100 deaths (24).

BREAST CANCER RISKS
In women, non-modifiable risk factors such as female sex, age, family history
and genetic mutations (BRCA 1/2), early age of menses and late age of menopause onset increase one’s risk for BC (20, 25, 26). Modifiable lifestyle risk
factors such as nulliparity (not having children), exposure to hormone therapy (estrogen), obesity, and alcohol consumption have also been found to
increases one’s risk for BC (20, 25, 26). In men, risk factors such as age, race,
genetic mutations (BRCA2 >BCRA 1), elevated estradiol serum levels, obesity,
gynecomastia, history of radiation exposure, diabetes and orchitis/epididymitis are associated with an increased risk for developing male breast cancer
(MBC) (27).
Breast tissue consists of lobules, ducts, and connective tissue, which produce milk, carry milk from lobules to the nipple, and surround the blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, ducts, and lobules, respectively (28, 29). BC can be
described based on its pattern of invasion into the surrounding tissue (28, 29).
Diagnosing BC following an abnormal mammography exam, requires a biopsy
of the area (30). If the presence of BC is pathologically confirmed, the neoplasm is further staged using the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, nodes, and metastases (TNM) system (30). The neoplasm is further checked for the presence or absence of biological markers
such as hormone receptors, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, or HER2 protein (ER+/–, PR +/–, Her2+/–) production is also assigned (30).
The staging then guides the treatment options, such as surgical resection,
chemotherapy, and radiation (30).
Ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) is a non-­invasive cancer with a predicted
diagnosis of 51,400 new cases in the USA for 2022 (29). Non-invasive DCIS
can further progress into invasive ductal cell carcinoma (IDC) (29), which is
the most commonly diagnosed BC in both men and women, with an anticipated 287,850 new cases in American women in 2022 (29). The second most
common type of BC is invasive lobular carcinomas (29). The highest 5-year
survival rate (99.1%) in the USA is seen in BC cases with tumors localized to
the initial place of origin (31). In comparison, BC tumors with a regional

Breast Cancer Epidemiology

lymph node spread have a 29% survival rate while women with metastatic BC
have only a 6% rate of survival (31). Additionally, in the USA the 5-year
survival rate in female BC is more significant than men’s (86.4% vs. 77.6%)
regardless of cancer stage, hormone-receptor status, HER2 status, age, year of
diagnosis, and other health factors (32).

BREAST CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY RATES
BY COUNTRY OR REGION
For each country or region, its BC incidence rate is presented first followed by the
associated mortality rate.

Breast Cancer Incidence in the United States of America (USA)
The 1950s expansion of BC educational programs and rise in BC awareness,
paired with the introduction and promotion of breast self-exams by the
American Cancer Society, highlighted the beginning rise of BC incidence in the
USA (33). According to the Connecticut Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results Programs (SEER) database, from 1950 to 1975, the USA incidence of BC
cases per 100,000 increased from 66.6 cases/100,000 to 119.2 cases/100,000 (34).
These numbers further increased with the introduction of mammography
screening from 1975 to 1987 (34). Further, the use of postmenopausal hormone
replacement therapy in women over 50 years increased women’s lifetime exposure to estrogen and contributed to the rise of invasive BC incidence from 1980
to early 2000s (4, 35, 36). In addition, from 1980 to 2008, the use of mammography screening increased by 41% in women over 50 years, increasing newly
diagnosed DCIS incidence from 7 cases/100,000 in 1980 to 83 cases/100,000 in
2008 (4, 35, 36).
During the late 1990s, a study conducted by the Women’s Health Initiative
reported a link between postmenopausal hormone therapy use, heart disease, and
BC (37). This was associated with a 13% decline in BC incidence from 1999 to
2004, in the USA (4, 35, 36). Since 2004, invasive BC incidence has increased by
less than 0.5% per year, while the incidence of local BC increased by 1.1% per
year from 2012 to 2016 (4).
According to the National Cancer Institute, BC is the most common cancer in
US women, accounting for 15% of new annual female cancer cases today (31).
The current lifelong probability of being diagnosed with BC is 12.9% (31). The
median age of women at diagnosis is 63 years making up 26.5% of new cases
amongst women ages 65-74 years (31). In 2022, approximately 287,850 new
female and 2,710 new male invasive BC cases will be diagnosed (21). Overall,
female BC incidence trends in the USA can be further observed in Figure 2 (38).

Breast Cancer Mortality in the USA
From 1950 to 1975, BC mortality in the USA increased slightly by 1.3
cases/100,000 with an overall trend as shown in Figure 3 (39). However, from
about 1990 to 2015 BC mortality declined as indicated in Figure 3 (39).

age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR). The decline in the ASMR between 1990 and 2015 is
evident from the graphic. Data are mean values of ASMR (39).

This decline is likely due to increased BC awareness, increased mammography
screening, and the use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment options (40). In
highly developed countries such as the USA, with better access to quality healthcare and established BC screening guidelines, BC tends to be diagnosed in its
earliest stages with a better overall chance of survival (35).
Although there was an increase in BC diagnoses over time, deaths from
­invasive BC have declined for white women, with the greatest reduction

between 1989 to 2009, in which mortality decreased from 33 cases/100,000
to 21 cases/100,000, respectively (36). However, black women living in the
USA, despite having a 4% lower incidence rate of BC, have a 41% higher BC
mortality rate than white women (40). The increased BC-related death rate in
black women is due to a later stage of diagnosis, obesity, comorbidities, less
access to timely and high-quality preventative care and treatment services
(4, 41–43). Furthermore, some studies suggest that because black women
have a higher incidence (38 cases/100,000) of triple-negative BC (ER-, PR-,
HER2-) than white women (19 cases/100,000) thus, black women have a
lower use and associated survival from hormonal chemotherapy treatments
such as Tamoxifen (4, 42). The probability of having longer gaps between
mammography screening, cancer detection, and follow-up in black women,
further lead to inequitable healthcare and contribute to the lower survival
rates reported (41–43).
Based on the Center for Disease Controls, National Center for Health
Statistics mortality files from 2015 to 2019, the ASMR in non-Hispanic black
women was the highest (28 cases/100,000) during that time (31). Followed by
non-Hispanic white women (199.9 cases/100,000), non-Hispanic American
Indian/Alaska Native women (17.8 cases/100,000), Hispanic women (13.7
cases/100,000), and Non-Hispanic American Indian /Alaska Native women
(17.8 cases/100,000) (31). Today, the median age at death due to BC in the USA
is 69 years, with 24.1% of women dying between the ages of 65–74 years (31).
The 5-year survival rate from 2012 to 2018 was 90.6% (31). According to the
American Cancer Society, 43,250 women and 530 men are expected to die from
BC in 2022 (21), while the projected 2040 BC mortality is expected to decrease
to 30,000 deaths (44).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Canada
Canadian BC incidence trends over the years, closely correlate with those
reported in the USA due to similar patterns of BC screening guideline establishments and mammography use in the North American region (45). The use of
breast self-exams was widely encouraged by the Canadian Cancer Society since
the early 1950s (46), followed by the establishment of formal screening guidelines in 1988 (47). In Canada’s Yukon and Northwest Territories, coordinated
screening programs began in 1990 and 2003, respectively. However, up until
2009, Nunavut province lacked organized screening (47). This earlier lack of
established organized screening of BC in Canada contributed to mammography
over screening and the rise in BC incidence between 1984 and 1991 by
2.1% (48). From 1992 to 2010, the ASIR was 114 cases/100,000 (48). After
1991, the annual incidence fluctuated with an ASIR peak of 1.57 cases/100,000
between 1992 and 2010 (48). There was a dip in the ASIR from 2002 to 2005
that was linked to a decrease in postmenopausal hormone treatments similarly
to what was seen in the USA (15). However, the overall BC incidence rate significantly declined by 0.2% per year between 1991 and 2015. Nevertheless, the
Canadian BC incidence has increased from 116.3 cases/100,000 in 1984 to 129
cases/100,000 in 2018 (49). The expected number of new BC cases in Canada
is 28,600, which will make up 25% of all new cancer cases in Canadian women
in 2022 (50).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Canada
Since the 1986 BC mortality peak in Canada, the ASMR declined by 48% from
1986 to 2019, (43 cases/100,000 in 1986 to 22 cases/100,000 in 2019) (49). This
decline is similar to the rest of the developed countries which adopted the use of
organized screening and improved BC treatment options (49). In 2019, BC
accounted for 13% of all cancer deaths in Canadian women (51). According to the
Canadian Cancer Society, BC became the most common cancer in Canadian
women (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) and was the second leading
cause of death from cancer in 2021 (52). In 2022, Canada is expected to have
15,203 BC-related deaths, with a 5-year survival estimate of 76% (50).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Latin America
Incidence of BC in Latin America varies widely across countries based on their
socio-economic status, healthcare coverage, availability of standard screening procedures, and use of mammography screening due to local public health expenditures and changing fertility patterns (53). As of April 2000, Argentina was the
only country where breast self-exams were not part of the recommended screening exams for women, while all Latin American countries supported clinical breast
exams (54). A study on the progression towards implementing national policies
and standard screening procedures for BC in Argentina, Columbia, Brazil,
Venezuela, and Mexico found that only Brazil and Mexico successfully incorporated BC into their public policy agenda, allocating funds to treat all stages of BC
by 2010 (55). Mammography screening in Latin America varies by country, with
a significant difference in the age of initiating mammography screening and the
frequency of BC screening exams (54). Countries including the Bahamas,
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay,
Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago still lacked BC screening policies in 2000 (54).
Based on a study analyzing the Global Burden of Disease data, the incidence of
BC increased in all Latin American regions and the Caribbean from 1990 to 2017
(Andean Latin America 29 cases/100,000 population, Central Latin America 39.5
cases/100,000 population, Tropical Latin America 41.6 cases/100,000, Southern
Latin America 52.8 cases/100,000 population, Caribbean 52.6 cases/100,000
population) (56). By 2018, the expected number of new BC cases in Latin America
and the Caribbean was 199,734, making up 14.9% of all new cancer cases (57).
In 2020, a total of 210, 000 new BC cases were reported in Latin America and the
Caribbean, the expected number of new cases for 2040 is 309,000 (58).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Latin America
From 1990 to 2015, the Latin American ASMR increased on average 1.48
cases/100,000 per year from 12.12 cases/100,000 to 19.64 cases/100,000, respectively (59). A complete systematic epidemiological study further confirms that
from 1990 to 2017, the overall percent ASMR increased by 11.3% in Andrea Latin
America, 12.2% in Central Latin America, 19.6% in Southern Latin America,
14.7% in Tropical Latin America and 18.8% (56). An observed decrease in the
total fertility rate, socio-economic development, and women’s lifestyle changes
(increased alcohol consumption, obesity, sedentary lifestyle) predispose women

Breast Cancer Epidemiology

to greater BC-related risk factors, thus reflecting in higher incidence rates uniformly in Latin America (60).
Based on the available statistics, specifically in 2008, 14% (36,952) of global
BC-related mortality occurred in Latin America (60). That year, countries such as
Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru had an estimated age-adjusted mortality
rate of 10 cases/100,000, while Panama, Chile, and Venezuela had an age-adjusted
mortality rate of 13 cases/100,000 (60). Regions such as Argentina and Uruguay,
which have a much higher incidence rate than other Latin American countries,
had an age-adjusted mortality rate of 24 cases/100,000 (60). BC further accounted
for 15% of total deaths due to BC in Latin America, with 53,000 deaths in
2018 (57). In 2020, a total of 57,000 women died from BC in Latin America, that
number is expected to nearly double by 2040 with a total BC-related mortality of
92,700 women (61).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Africa
Limited BC related epidemiological data is available for African countries (62) due
to a lack of quality cancer registries and number of registrations (63). In fact, from
1978 to 1982, there were no reported cancer registries based on the lack of African
representatives in the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume V (64).
However, despite a slow progression, cancer registries and their quality have been
slowly improving in areas such as Nigeria, which established its National System
of Cancer Registries in 2009 (64). Similarly, Uganda established two cancer institutes (Uganda Cancer Institute and Kampala Cancer Registry) since then (65). By
2014, there were 25 population-based cancer registries covering 10.5% of the
sub-Saharan African population (64), and in 2006, 11% of the population-based
cancer registries were reported in Africa (63). The importance of having cancer
registries lies in their ability to offer a systematic collection, storage, understanding, and calculation of cancer incidence and mortality rates along with other epidemiologically significant factors and estimate regional disease burden (64).
According to the Global Burden of Disease data estimates, the percent
increase of BC incidence based on the ASIR from 1990 to 2017 was 24.4 % in
Central sub-Sahara Africa, 39.4% in Western sub-Sahara Africa, 24.1% in
Eastern Subsabra Africa and 30.3% in Southern sub-Sahara Africa (56). In 2018,
the ASIR ranged from 6.9 cases /100,000 in Gambia to 69.6 cases/100,000 in
Mauritius, with an overall ASIR for Africa of 37.9 cases/100,000 (66). By 2020,
BC became the most common cancer diagnosed among African women, with
186,598 new cases (67).
In 2020, the five participating countries with the highest BC ASIR ranged
from 20.0 cases/100,000 in Zambia and 22.2 cases/100,000 in Uganda to 49.0
cases/100,000 in Nigeria, 52.6 cases/100,000 in South Africa, and 57.6
cases/100,000 in Namibia (68). That same year, a total of 186,000 new BC cases
were recorded in Africa and that number is expected to nearly double by 2040,
with a projected estimate of 337,000 (69).
In general, BC incidence rates continue to increase in Africa due to women
delaying childbirth, having fewer children, adopting westernized lifestyles such
as delaying marriage, and decreasing the length of breastfeeding (66). In contrast to non-African geographical regions, where BC is more frequent in women
over 50 years, African incidence rates are growing in younger premenopausal

9

10

Arzanova E and Mayrovitz HN

women ages 30–49 (66). Factors such as African women’s short overall life
expectancy of 66 years (70) exaggerate the incidence rates of younger women
compared to the global female life expectancy of 71 years (70, 71). The low
median age of the African female population leads to a more significant proportion of BC diagnoses among younger women (71, 72).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Africa
From 1990 to 2017, the percent change in BC ASMR in regions of Africa was:
17.5% in Central sub-Sahara Africa, 13% in Southern sub-Sahara Africa, 7.2% in
Northern Africa and the Middle East, 8.4% in Western sub-Sahara Africa, and
3.4% in Eastern sub-Sahara Africa (56). In 2018, Nigeria was the leading country
in absolute BC burden with 11,564 deaths, followed by 9,254 deaths in Egypt (66).
Despite the high and increasing BC mortality rates in sub-Sahara Africa, the
prevalence of BC screening is low, with an overall prevalence of 12.9% in 39,646
women ages 15-49 years old recorded in 2020 (73), however women ages 45–49
have the highest mortality rate due to BC (66). Late-stage presentation of BC is
largely to blame for low survival rates in sub-Saharan Africa, where 77% of all
newly diagnosed BC cases are in stage III/IV (7). Furthermore, in a study of 2,156
women diagnosed with BC and tracked for three years until January 2019, a significant difference in survival rates was observed among white African women
compared to black African women (74). The overall BC 3-year survival rate was
50% in Namibia, with a 90% survival rate for white women, but only a 56% survival rate for black women. In South Africa mixed-race women had a 3-year survival rate of 76% compared to a 59% survival rate for black women (74). The
highest determinants for increased survival were determined to be early diagnosis
and treatment improvements, with an overall improvement in survival by 22% in
Nigeria, Zambia, and Uganda (74). In 2020, the recorded overall BC-related
ASMR was 88.8 cases/100,000, ranging from 56.6 cases/100,000 in the Republic
of Congo to 139.4 cases/100,000 in Zimbabwe (67). To summarize, 416,000
women are expected to die from BC in sub-Saharan Africa from 2020 to 2029, yet
at least a third of these deaths might be avoided with early diagnosis of BC and
effective treatments (74).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Europe
England and the Netherlands established their national BC screening programs in
the mid-1980s, similarly to other highly developed countries (3). Implementation
of organized mammography screening programs, supported by the European
Council, increased by 2006 (75). Additionally, since 2007, most European countries have switched from film to digital mammography screening that has a higher
sensitivity for detecting BC neoplasm in dense breasts (76). Other studies of 14
European countries from 1980 to 2018 have demonstrated a decline in BC-related
mortality (76). The decline was somewhat age-dependent and was between 1.5%
to 5.4% in women aged 50-59, 0.2% to 8.1% in women aged 60-69, and a 0% to
7.1% in women aged 70-79 years. Another study completed in Western Europe is
consistent with the findings that the use of mammography screening along with
broader availability of organized screening programs reduces BC-related mortality
in women aged 50–74 years by 25–30% (75).

Breast Cancer Epidemiology

Although the incidence of BC has increased in European nations secondary to
the improvements of BC screening and awareness, mortality has been declining as
observed in other highly developed countries (75–78). Further, studies support
that a similar trend of increased BC incidence was seen across Europe during the
early 1990s and 2000s when the use of hormone replacement therapy began, with
a subsequent decline when the use of such therapies declined in highly developed
countries (79, 80). Denmark, where the BC incidence rate decreased by 1.2%
annually from 2002 to 2010, serves an example of that decline (62).
From 1999 to 2003, BC accounted for 26% of all cancer incidents in Denmark,
Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Greenland (81). From 1993 to 2007, BC
incidence rates declined by 0.3% in Austria, while Croatia had a stable increase in
incidence of 2.2% during the same time (62). In Malta and Croatia, incidence
rates increased by 0.5% and 2.2% respectively from 1993 to 2007 (62). Meanwhile,
Slovenia’s incidence rate declined from 5.7% in 1997 to 0.9% by 2010 (62). In
France, incidence trends began to decline in 2009 by 1.2% (62).
In Belarus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, incidence rates increased by
1.7%–2.2% per year from 1993 to 2007/2008 (62). In Russia, where data reported
might not be accurate due to a lack of organized screening programs and BC registries, the BC ASIR increased from 33.1 cases/100,000 to 54.2 cases/100,000
from 1993 to 2019 (82). By 2020, Belgium had the highest incidence rate of BC
in the world with an ASIR of 113.2 cases/100,000 followed by the Netherlands
(100.9 cases/100,000), Luxemburg (99.8 cases/100,000), and France (99.1
cases/100,000) (7). Overall, the number of new BC cases in Europe was 531,000
in 2020, which is predicted to increase to 568,000 by 2040 (83).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Europe
As previously mentioned, in Europe, the increase in incidence of BC inversely
correlates with mortality (82). While incidence rates continue to increase,
BC-related death rates are decreasing due to adequate healthcare, increased BC
screening and earlier diagnosis of BC in women since the 1990s (82). Northern
European countries have seen a decrease in mortality since the mid-1990s
except Latvia which had a stable 0.1% decline per year since 2002 (62).
Denmark has had a 2.9% annual decrease in mortality rates from 1996 to 2012,
however it has one of the highest BC mortality rates overall (62). Western
European countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Austria had
a decreasing BC-related mortality rate since 2003 (62). Based on the reports
from six cancer registries, the BC-mortality rate also declined in Switzerland by
1% since 2000 (62). In Eastern Europe, mortality has been increasing in places
such as Russia, Estonia, Romania and Hungary from 1993 to 1997 the latest for
which data was found (3).
Reports of BC mortality in Southern Europe (62) indicate that Italy had a variable mortality rate that increased from 1993 to 1999 by 4.6% annually then followed a steady decline of 0.8% per year from 2000 to 2007. Further, Croatia was
reported to have a stable annual mortality rate increase of 2.2% per year from
1993 to 2007. Spain’s mortality rate declined 2.1% per year from 1993-1995 followed by an increase of 2.8% per year between 1996-2002 then declined 1.3%
until 2007. A more recent study completed in 27 European countries, reported
that from 2012 to 2017 the overall BC-related mortality decreased by 3.9% from

11

12

Arzanova E and Mayrovitz HN

15.0 cases/100,000 in 2012 to 14.4 cases/100,000 in 2017 (77). According to
2020 data, the total number of deaths due to BC in Europe was 142,000, while
that number is projected to increase to 171,000 by 2040 (84).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Asia
The 48 countries comprising Asia differ broadly in BC incidence trends over time
(85). From 1990 to 2017, ASIR increased by 54% in Central Asia, 89.5% in East
Asia, and 76.7% in South Asia (56). Per year changes in ASIR from 1993 to 2007
amounted to 4.8% in Thailand, 3.0% in Japan and 4.1% in China from 1993 to
2001 but 1.6% from 2001 to 2007 (62). Despite the increasing incidence, in
2006, only 8% of the total Asian population was covered by population-based
cancer registries (63). Studies conducted in 2010 found that population-based
cancer registries in Asia increased to 20%, but with only four registries to cover
the entire populations of Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, and China (86).
Thus, for a region that has nearly 60% of the world’s population (87), the reported
numbers might be lower than the exact due to inadequate tracking of new BC
cases (63).
In 2012, 651,000 Asian women were diagnosed with BC, making up 38.8% of
global BC cases (85). In 2018, 10% of all cancers in Asia were due to BC (845,400
total cases) (88). By 2040 the number of new BC cases in Asia is expected to reach
1.34 million (89).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Asia
From 1990 to 2017 ASMR increased by 15% in South Asia, 13.9% in Central
Asia, 14.9% in Southeastern Asia, and 8.6% in Eastern Asia (56). More specifically, it has been reported that from 1997 to 2001 and 2007 to 2009, the
BC-related mortality in rural China increased by 20%, while the urban regions
reported a 7% drop (90). It was suggested that efforts to expand the availability
of high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment and primary prevention
methods focusing on weight loss have been suggested to help China minimize
BC-related mortality. This study further suggested that BC management in Asia
is also complicated by a lack of awareness, proper diagnostic equipment, healthcare competition, and reliance on traditional approaches.
Overall, BC ASMR is predicted to increase by 2030 in East Asia by 7% since
1990 from 9.10 cases/100,000 to 9.88 cases/100,000 and 35% in South Asia from
13.4 cases/100,000 to 18.1 cases/100,000 in women ages 50–80 years (91).
Imminent lifestyle changes such as reducing red meat consumption, better glycemic control, and increased activity paired with improved access to treatment and
earlier diagnoses may reduce the current projected mortality trends in Asia and
the rest of the world (91).

Breast Cancer Incidence in Oceania
BC incidence in Australia increased steadily in women ages 50–69 years with the
start of mammography screening in 1984 (3). By 1992, mammography became
available to all women over the age of 40, and the incidence rates further reflected a
more significant increase with a broader female age variation (3). New Zealand had

Breast Cancer Epidemiology

a similar increase in incidence reported from 1978 to 1992 (3). Like other highly
developed regions, Oceania had a drop in incidence rates after the declining use of
postmenopausal hormone therapy in the early 2000s (92). From 1990 to 2017,
ASIR data reported separately for Oceania and Australasia indicated an overall
increase of 40.7% and 84.7% respectively (56). In 2018, 13.9% of all new cancer
cases were due to BC in Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia (88). The
2020 BC ASIR was 99 cases/100,000 in New Caledonia, Australia (96 cases/100,000),
followed by New Zealand (93 cases/100,000) and Samoa (81.4 cases/100,000),
while the lowest was in Vanuatu (30.4 cases/100,000), Guam (41.3 cases/100,000),
Papua New Guinea (35.9 cases/100,000) and Solomon Islands (48.2 cases/100,000)
(93). The overall number of new BC cases in Oceania was 25,700 in 2020. The
expected number of new cases in 2040 is estimated at 34,800 new BC cases (94).

Breast Cancer Mortality in Oceania
BC mortality in Australia rose steadily from the early 1970s to the 1980s but declined
in the late 1980s and early 1990s (95). The decrease was 4.2% in women aged
25–49 and 3.2% in women aged 50–69. The observed decline was due to increased
efforts in breast screening between 1988 and 1994 and a subsequent increase in BC
awareness (95). In 2018, BC accounted for 7% of all cancer mortalities reported in
Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia (88). The 2018, ASMR was highest in Fiji (41 cases/100,000), Papua New Guinea (27.7 cases/100,000), Samoa
(25.6 cases/100,000), and French Polynesia (20.6 cases/100,000), while the lowest
ASMR was in Vanuatu (9.5 cases/100,000) (93). In 2020, 4,990 women died from
BC in Oceania, that number is expected to be 7,910 by 2040 (96).

CONCLUSION
Breast cancer incidence is increasing globally with cases expected to reach 364,000
in the year 2040. Part of this increase may be attributed to improved detection but
some, especially in lower developed countries, may be due to changes in female
fertility patterns along with lifestyle changes (97). Increased awareness, early detection and improved treatments in highly developed regions have significantly contributed to decreasing breast cancer related mortality. However, lack of resources
and limited access to quality healthcare continue to disproportionately affect lower
socioeconomic regions of the world where breast cancer mortality is high. Better
organized screening programs, establishment of breast cancer registries, and more
widespread use of mammography screening in lower developmental regions of the
world can increase early-stage breast cancer diagnosis, reduce breast cancer-related
mortality, and help reduce future global breast cancer burden.

Abstract: The etiology of breast cancer is attributed to a complex interaction
between various modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This etiology is determined by genetics, environmental, nutritional, hormonal, and heritable elements
that contribute to the development of this disease. Risk factors include prior history of breast cancer, positive family history, obesity, tall stature, smoking, alcohol
consumption, early menarche, late menopause, sedentary lifestyle, nulliparity and
hormone replacement therapy. Factors associated with decreased risk of breast
cancer include multiparity, history of breastfeeding, physical activity, weight loss,
and prophylactic surgical and medical interventions. In the United States, approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime.
This disease is more common in white, post-menopausal females. Risk increases
with older age with about 80% of breast cancer patients being older than 50 years.
Analyzing the etiology of breast cancer allows for the development of improved
screening and treatment interventions. In this chapter, the etiology of breast cancer along with the risk factors associated with this disease are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
In the United States, there is a 12.3% average life risk that a woman will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime (1). This makes this disease the second
most common cancer for women in the United States following skin cancer. The
etiology of breast cancer is a complex interplay between multiple risk factors
including prior history of breast cancer, positive family history, obesity, tall stature, smoking, alcohol consumption, early menarche, late menopause, sedentary
lifestyle, nulliparity and hormone replacement therapy. Factors associated with
decreased risk of breast cancer include multiparity, history of breastfeeding, physical activity, and weight loss. The influence of factors such as obesity and fertility
on the etiology of breast cancer is displayed by the continued increase of breast
cancer incidence rates of about 0.5% annually which has been attributed to a
national increase in body weight and a decrease in fertility (1). Breast cancer is
much more likely to occur in females than males, and it is also highly associated
with advancing age and race with White females having the highest overall rates
of breast cancer followed by Black, Asian, and Hispanic females respectively.
Women with a first-degree relative who have had breast cancer are twice to three
times more likely to develop breast cancer in their lifetime (2). The goal of this
chapter is to explore the etiology of breast cancer to help provide a better understanding of the risk factors of this disease to potentially aid further research into
the prevention and management of this disease.

FACTORS AFFECTING BREAST CANCER RISK
As noted, there are multiple interactive factors that impact breast cancer occurrences and in the subsequent sections the main features of these will be discussed.

Gender
Annually about 280,000 women and 3,000 men are diagnosed with breast cancer
in the United States. Women are therefore about 100 times more likely to develop
breast cancer compared to men (3). The more pronounced prevalence of breast
cancer in women is mainly due to higher estrogen and progesterone stimulation.
In post-menopausal women, the amount of circulating estrogens and androgens
has been shown to be positively correlated with the risk of breast cancer (4).
In men, the increase in estrogen to androgen ratio that is either due to estrogen
excess or androgen deficiency is positively correlated with the risk of breast
cancer (5). Also, both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women experience
more alternations of sex hormone levels in their lifetime compared to men resulting in higher breast cancer risk (6).

Age
Most cases of breast cancer are diagnosed in women older than 50 years, and the
breast cancer risk continues to increase with advancing age (7–9). The Surveillance,

Breast Cancer Etiology

Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database showed that the probability of a
woman developing breast cancer is 2.4% in ages 50 to 59, 3.5% in ages 60 to 69,
and 7.0% in ages 70 and older (10). The increased breast cancer incidence with
advancing age parallels the age dependence of many common cancers that is
partly due to age-related increase in carcinogenesis and the accumulation of cellular modifications throughout time (11). There is also a relationship between age
of diagnosis and outcome prognosis. Women diagnosed with breast cancer at an
age lower than 50 have lower survival rates than those diagnosed at ages between
50 and 70 (9). The lower survival rate in younger patients is most likely due to the
greater occurrence of highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer in patients
40 years old or younger.

Heritable factors and cancer genetics
Personal history of breast cancer is associated with increased, but still low, risk of
developing breast cancer in the contralateral breast. The average risk of breast
cancer survivors developing breast cancer on the opposite breast is estimated to
increase by 0.5% each year following their initial cancer diagnosis (12). This
increased risk could be largely attributed to increasing age since it is only slightly
larger than the age-related increase in breast cancer in patients without prior
history of breast cancer.
A first-degree family history of breast cancer increases the risk of breast cancer
significantly. Studies show that the risk of breast cancer is doubled in a woman
with a first-degree relative with prior breast cancer history. First-degree relatives
for women are mother, sister, and daughter while second-degree relatives are
grandmother, aunts, and nieces. A woman who has two first-degree relatives who
have had breast cancer has triple the risk of a woman with no family history of
breast cancer (13). According to a large cohort study of over 5,000,000 women,
those who had a second-degree relative with breast cancer, but no first-degree
relative with this history, had a 20% increased risk when the relative had carcinoma in situ and 30% when the cancer was invasive (14).
The significant association between positive family history and increased
breast cancer risk is linked to having gene abnormalities. Most women who test
positive for a gene associated with hereditary breast cancer have a pathogenic
variant in either breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2). According to a large prospective study, the cumulative
cancer risk is 72% (95% CI 65 to 79 percent) in BRCA1 mutation carriers and
69% (95% CI 61 to 77 percent) in BRCA2 mutation carriers (15). Breast cancer
incidence was also shown to increase in early adulthood until the average age of
35 years for BRCA1 carriers and until the average age of 45 years for BRCA2
­carriers. The overall risk of breast cancer is about 3% higher in carriers of BRCA1
mutations compared to women with BRCA2 mutations (16–18).

Geography, ethnicity and race
Breast cancer incidence differs around the world. Incidence rates of breast cancer
are higher in North America, North and West Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
However, the mortality rate of breast cancer is similar around the world (19).

In the United States, breast cancer risk differs among different race groups with
the highest overall incidence of breast cancer being found in White women (131.8
per 100,000) followed by Black women (124.7 in 100,000) (20). The risk is
decreased among Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan
Native women. It is important to note that although white women have the h
­ ighest
overall risk, black women have the highest risk of early onset breast cancer under
the age of 45 years old (21) Black women also have higher breast cancer mortality
rate and are more likely to present with advanced disease (22).

Obesity
Obesity is associated with an overall increased risk of breast cancer. The link
between increased Body Mass Index (BMI) and breast cancer is found primarily
in post-menopausal women that form estrogen positive breast cancer (6, 23).
However, the relationship between obesity and risk of breast cancer differs based
on menopausal status. According to data obtained from several studies, a higher
BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 has been shown to be associated with post-menopausal breast
cancer risk (24–27). According to a meta-analysis of several studies, the relative
risk of breast cancer among obese post-menopausal women is 1.1 per 5 BMI units
(95% CI 1.1–1.2) (28). The higher estrogen levels among obese women have been
attributed to this association. This reasoning is further strengthened by the fact
that a higher body fat percentage among women with a normal BMI is also
­associated with a higher breast cancer risk (29). However, in premenopausal
women, a higher BMI is reported to be associated with a reduced breast cancer
risk (30). The cause of this inverse relationship is not yet known.

Stature
Tall stature has also been associated with increased risk of breast cancer (3, 31).
According to data from seven prospective cohort studies that included more than
337,000 women, increased height is an independent risk factor for breast cancer.
The relative risk of breast cancer for women 1.75 meter (about 69 inches) or taller
compared with women shorter than 1.60 meter (about 63 inches) were 1.22
for all women with a relative risk of 1.42 for premenopausal women and 1.28 for
postmenopausal women (32). There is no definitive conclusion on the reason for
the association between height and breast cancer. However, there are proposed
explanations of nutritional, genetic and environmental factors during early childhood that play an effect on growth hormone release having direct impact on future
breast cancer development (32).

Physical activity and nutrition
Several studies have shown that there is an association between increased physical
activity and lower risk of breast cancer (33–35). As an example, a large-scale
meta-analysis of more than 230,000 breast cancer cases and millions of controls
has shown that the risk of breast cancer is lower among women who exercise
regularly compared with those who are least active (33). Physical activity is protective against the development of breast cancer in all women including those

Breast Cancer Etiology

with and without a family history of this disease (6). Both physical activity and
dietary patterns are also linked with BMI which, as earlier discussed, if elevated to
the level of obesity is strongly associated with the risk of developing breast cancer
in post-menopausal women. Exercise has been linked to reduced estrogen and
insulin levels which could also play an important factor in reducing breast cancer
risk (36).
With regards to nutrition, a 20-year-long prospective study of post-menopausal
women showed that a low-fat diet is associated with higher breast cancer survival
rates (37). Overall, the consumption of red meats, processed foods, soy products,
and fatty foods is linked to increased risk of breast cancer while increased
consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber is linked to decreased risk (38).
However, there are still several inconsistent findings with regards to the association and degree of impact these factors have on breast cancer development because
different studies have yielded differing outcomes (38–40). Further research in the
form of randomized trials and data gathering is needed to make a definite
conclusion.

Alcohol consumption and smoking
A meta-analysis of more than 100 studies reported a positive association between
breast cancer and low alcohol consumption (< 3–4 drinks/week), and high consumption (> 20 drinks/week), compared to no alcohol consumption (41).
According to a large prospective study looking into the relationship between
alcohol and breast cancer, there was a small increase in risk of breast cancer with
3 to 6 drinks/week compared with abstainers, with a relative risk of 1.15 (95%
CI 1.06–1.24) (42). Lifetime alcohol intake was reported to be linearly correlated
with breast cancer risk and risk was most strongly associated with very early and
very late adult life drinking habits (43). The link between alcohol consumption
and breast cancer risk may be related to alcohol’s effect on estrogen metabolism
causing an increase in blood estrogen levels. A cross-sectional study of the relationship between breast cancer risk and hormone concentration among postmenopausal women found that estrogen levels, that correlate with increased
breast cancer risk, are increased in women who drink alcohol than in those who
do not while dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and sex hormone-­
binding globulin (SHBG) levels were decreased (44).
Smoking has been shown by many studies to be associated with increased
breast cancer risk. According to one meta-analysis of several prospective studies,
the risk of breast cancer was higher among women with a history of smoking with
a relative risk of 1.10 (95% CI 1.02–1.14) (45). In one prospective study of more
than 100,000 women, smoking was associated with a 5% increase in the risk of
breast cancer particularly in women who started smoking as an adolescent (46).

Menarche and menopause
Younger age at menarche and later age of menopause increases breast cancer risk
(47). These investigators reported that relative risk for breast cancer, attributable
to late onset menopause, increased by a factor of 1.029 (95% CI 1.025–1.032)
for each added year of menopause onset. Breast cancer risk attributable to early

25

26

Admoun C and Mayrovitz HN

menarche is increased by a factor of 1.050 (95% CI 1.044–1.057) for every year
younger at menarche (47). The younger the woman at menarche, the higher the
risk of her developing breast cancer in the future. The effects of early menarche
and late menopause on breast cancer has been attributed to greater lifetime exposure to endogenous estrogen. However, several studies have shown a more significant increase of breast cancer risk in women with early menarche compared to
older age of menopause (47, 48). This suggests that the cause of this correlation is
not entirely due to the duration a woman is exposed to high estrogen levels in her
lifetime. Further research regarding the difference in breast cancer risk between
early menarche and late menopause is needed to investigate the cause behind
these findings.

Reproductive history and breastfeeding
Multiple studies have shown that both multiparity and breastfeeding have a protective effect against breast cancer. Breast feeding for at least six months has been
shown to have the most effect in decreasing breast cancer risk. Data obtained from
47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries found that on average, women with
breast cancer had less births and less or shorter breastfeeding history. The relative
risk of breast cancer decreased by 4.3% (95% CI 2.9–5.8) for every one year of
breastfeeding in addition to a decrease of 7.0% (95% CI 5.0–9.0) for each
birth (49). There are also findings that this reduction in breast cancer was most
significant in receptor negative breast cancers thus reducing aggressive disease
subtypes (50).

Endogenous estrogen and hormonal therapy
Higher levels of estrogen in premenopausal and post-menopausal women have
been associated with increased risk of breast cancer. A systematic review that
analyzed data from several epidemiologic studies found that in six prospective
studies, serum estradiol concentration of 329 women who developed breast
­cancer later in their life had higher estradiol blood concentrations compared to
women who did not subsequently develop breast cancer (51). The reported
­estradiol concentration was 15% greater in those who developed breast cancer
(CI 95% 6%–24%).
Post-menopausal women without a history of a total hysterectomy who underwent combined estrogen and progesterone replacement therapy have been shown
to have increased risk of breast cancer (52). Multiple observational studies have
reported an increased risk of breast cancer with use of menopausal hormone therapy, including unopposed estrogen therapy and combined estrogen-progestin
therapy, for a prolonged duration (49, 53). The use of combined estrogenprogestin therapy for a short period of time, which was defined as four years or
less, did not significantly increase breast cancer risk (54). However, both shortterm and long-term use combined therapy has been linked to increased difficulty
of breast cancer mammographic detection. The short-term use of unopposed
estrogen therapy had similar outcomes to combined estrogen-progestin therapy
neither of which caused increased risk (53). However, there was increased risk
with long-term use of more than 10 years.

Breast Cancer Etiology

CONCLUSION
Breast cancer is caused by a complex interplay of multiple factors including age,
genetics, environment, and reproductive history and probably yet unknown factors. The risk of breast cancer increases with older age and is most common in
post-menopausal women. Genetics and heritable factors play an important role in
the development of breast cancer. A first-degree family history of breast cancer
significantly increases breast cancer risk. Potentially modifiable factors including
obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical inactivity, and replacement hormonal therapy have all been associated with increased breast cancer risk. Women’s
reproductive history also affects risk with nulliparity associated with increased
rates compared to multiparity. Breast cancer is the leading cancer affecting women
in the United States and globally. Being aware of its etiology aids understanding its
pathophysiology and helps bring into focus important preventative measures that
can be taken to reduce risk. Screening measures, treatment modalities, and patient
counseling and education can all be enhanced by understanding the etiology of
breast cancer.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease with
multiple subtypes. The classification of these subtypes has evolved over the
years. The most common and widely accepted classification of breast cancer is
from an immunohistochemical perspective, based on the expression of the
­following hormone receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor (HER2). Accordingly, the following four subtypes of breast
cancer are widely recognized: luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive, and triplenegative. With the recent advances in cancer research, and an increased molecular understanding of breast cancer, the current clinical model for classification of
breast cancer may be benefit from the addition of several molecular markers such
as miRNAs (let-7, miR-155, miR-150, miR-153) and mutations (p53, BRCA
1 and 2 genes). This chapter provides an overview of the characteristics of these
four subtypes of breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. It is a highly
heterogeneous neoplasm with distinct subtypes. These subtypes are commonly
grouped into four categories based on the immunohistochemical expression of
hormone receptors: estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor positive (HER2+), and triplenegative (TNBC), which is characterized by the lack of expression of any of the
above receptors (1). Estrogen receptor (ER) is an important diagnostic determinant, as approximately 70–75% of invasive breast carcinomas are characterized by
significantly high ER expression (2, 3). The progesterone receptor (PR) is expressed
in more than 50% of ER-positive patients, and very rarely in those with ER-negative
breast cancer. PR expression is regulated by ER (4); therefore, physiological PR
values inform about the functional ER pathway. However, both ER and PR are
abundantly expressed in breast cancer cells, and both are considered diagnostic
and prognostic biomarkers of breast cancer (5). Higher expression of PR is positively associated with overall survival, time to recurrence, and time to treatment
failure or progression, while lower levels are generally associated with a more
aggressive course of disease, as well as poorer recurrence and prognosis (6).
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression accounts for
approximately 15–25% of breast cancers and its status is mainly relevant in the
choice of appropriate treatment (7, 8). HER2 overexpression is one of the earliest
events during breast carcinogenesis (8). HER2 increases the detection rate of metastatic or recurrent breast cancers by 50% and even 80%. Serum HER2 levels are
considered a promising real-time marker for the presence or recurrence of tumors.
HER2 amplification leads to increased overactivation of proto-oncogenic signaling
pathways leading to uncontrolled cancer cell growth, which corresponds with
worse clinical outcomes of HER2+ cases. HER2 overexpression also correlates with
a significantly shorter disease-free period (9). The Ki67 antigen is a cellular marker
of proliferation and is an excellent marker for providing information on cell proliferation. The proliferative activities determined by Ki67 reflect the aggressiveness of
the cancer along with response to treatment and time to recurrence (10). Therefore,
Ki-67 is crucial in terms of choosing the appropriate treatment therapy, and possible follow-ups for recurrence. It could also be considered as a possible prognostic
factor. High expression of Ki67 also reflects lower survival rates (11, 12).
The need for molecular classification is to categorize patients who may
benefit from targeted therapy, such as hormone therapy and anti HER2 therapy (13). Recently, the identification of differentially expressed genes, long
non-coding RNAs, and RNA binding proteins for each breast cancer subtype
were reported: RASDF7 for luminal A, DCTPP1 for luminal B, DHRS11,
KLC3, NAG3 and TMEM98 for HER2, and ABDHD14A and ADSSL1 for
TNBC, providing preliminary evidence to identify new prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for individual breast cancer subtypes (14).
This chapter focuses on the four major subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A,

luminal B, HER2-positive, and TNBC subtypes. The characteristics of these
four subtypes are presented in Table 1 (15–28). Luminal cancers mainly
express low molecular weight cytokeratins (CK7, CK8, CK18, among others),
and three groups are distinguished from the IHC point of view: luminal A,
luminal B and HER2 (15).

LUMINAL A SUBTYPE
Luminal A tumors are characterized by the presence of ER and/or PR and the
absence of HER2, and have a low expression of cell proliferation marker Ki-67
(less than 20%) (Figure 1). Clinically they are low grade, slow growing, and have
the best prognosis with less incidence of relapse and higher survival rate. These
carcinomas present a high response rate to hormone therapy (tamoxifen or aromarase inhibitors), and a more limited benefit to chemotherapy (27). For this
reason, according to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and
National Comprehensive Cancer Network from USA (NCCN) Guidelines, the use
of genetic platforms is recommended in this group to establish which patients
would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy treatment based on the risk of relapse

and survival rate (29, 30). Relapse is more frequent at the bone level, with a lower
rate of visceral and central nervous system (CNS) relapses. Likewise, they have a
longer survival in case of relapse (31).

LUMINAL B SUBTYPE
Luminal B tumors are of higher grade and worse prognosis compared to Luminal
A. They are ER positive and can be PR negative and have a high expression of
Ki67 (greater than 20%) (Figure 2). They are generally of intermediate/high
histologic grade. These tumors may benefit from hormonal therapy along with
­chemotherapy. The elevated Ki67 makes them grow faster than luminal A and
worse prognosis (32). It constitutes 10–20% of luminal tumors. It has a

moderately low expression of estrogen receptors, and increased expression of
proliferation and cell cycle genes. It represents the group of luminal tumors with
the worst prognosis. They benefit from hormone therapy and in a higher percentage from chemotherapy compared to the previous group (33). Although
bone recurrence is frequent, they have a higher rate of visceral recurrence, and
survival from diagnosis to relapse is lower (34, 35).

HER2 SUBTYPE
The HER2-positive group constitutes 10–15% of breast cancers and is characterized by high HER2 expression with absence of ER and PR (Figure 3). They
grow faster than the luminal ones and the prognosis has improved after the

introduction of HER2-targeted therapies. The HER2-positive subtype is more
aggressive and fast-growing. Within this, two subgroups can be distinguished:
luminal HER2 (E+, PR+, HER2+ and Ki-67:15–30%) and HER2-enriched
(HER2+, E-, PR-, Ki-67>30%) (36). They have a worse prognosis compared to
luminal tumors, and require specific drugs directed against the HER2/neu
protein, including trastuzumab, trastuzumab combined with emtasin (T-DM1),
pertuzumab, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib and neratinib,
among others, in addition to surgery and treatment with precise chemotherapy (37). They have a high response rate to chemotherapy schemes (38). Bone
localization is the most common site for disseminated disease, and visceral
relapses are also more frequent in this subgroup compared to the previous
group (39, 40).

Subtypes of Breast Cancer

TNBC SUBTYPE
Triple-negative breast cancer is ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative
(Figure 4). They constitute about 20% of all breast cancers. It is most common
among women under 40 years of age, and in African-American women. The
TNBC subtype is further classified into several additional subgroups including
basal-like (BL1 and BL2), claudin-low, mesenchymal (MES), luminal androgen receptor (LAR), and immunomodulatory (IM), the first two being the
most frequent with 50–70% and 20–30% of cases (41). Moreover, each of
these has unique clinical outcomes, phenotypes, and pharmacological sensitivities. TNBC presents an aggressive behavior and 80% of breast cancer

personal collection.

tumors (tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and BRCA2) belong to this group (28).
The risk of developing TNBC varies with genetics, race, age, overweight and
obesity, breastfeeding patterns, and parity (41, 42). TNBC is characterized by
its aggressiveness, early relapse, and a greater tendency to present in advanced
stages. It presents a high proliferation rate, alteration in DNA repair genes and
increased genomic instability. Histologically, it is a poorly differentiated,
highly proliferative, heterogeneous neoplasm, including subsets of variable
prognosis. Immunohistochemically, they are subdivided into basal and nonbasal TNBC; the former characterized by expression of cytokeratins (CK)5/6
and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (EGFR1), while the nonbasal do not express CK5/6 cytokeratins.

METASTASIS, OVERALL SURVIVAL, AND RELAPSE
Given the early detection and multiple treatments available against breast cancer,
the mortality rate has decreased. However, distant metastases are not uncommon,
and for women with advanced breast cancer, the median survival time is 2–3 years
(43, 44). In most cases, metastatic breast cancer is uncommon at initial presentation, occurring in about 6–7% of newly diagnosed cases; ­however, approximately
30% of patients initially diagnosed with earlier stages of breast cancer eventually
develop recurrent or metastatic disease (45–47).
In 2018, Xiao et al. (48) performed a detailed analysis of the association
between breast cancer subtypes and the risk of developing distant metastasis.
They found that newly diagnosed breast cancers presented with bone (3.28%),
lung (1.52%), liver (1.2%), and brain (0.35%) metastasis at diagnosis. They also
reported that, metastatic sites and subtypes significantly affected the overall survival after metastasis. Moreover, they found that luminal B subtype significantly
correlated with elevated bone metastasis risk, whereas luminal A did not. Both
luminal subtypes were significantly associated with higher rates of liver, brain,
and lung metastasis, while the highest odds ratio was observed in liver metastasis.
TNBC had a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases, but a significantly
lower rate of bone metastases than luminal A subtype.
Regarding survival rate, the National Cancer Institute (49) reports the ‘5-year
relative survival percentage’, showing that the best survival pattern was for women
with luminal A subtype with 94.4% survival rate, followed by the luminal B subtype with 90.7%, HER2 subtype with 84.8%, and the TNBC subtype had the
worst survival, with 77.1%. It is important to mention that, although the breast
cancer subtype affects survival, stage at diagnosis may be the most powerful factor
in determining survival outcome.
Finally, relapse of breast cancer may differ depending on the subtype (50).
Ignatov et al. (51) investigated relapse in breast cancer patients. They found that
HER2 and TNBC had the highest rate of local and regional recurrence,
7.5 and 3.4% for HER2 and 7.6 and 3.3% for TNBC, respectively. Luminal A
subtype were recurrent in 1.5 and 0.7% local and regional, respectively, and
luminal B subtype was associated in 2.9 and 1.5% of the cases with local and
regional relapse. Moreover, the authors found that, even though the rate of

Subtypes of Breast Cancer

recurrence for luminal and luminal B subtypes was initially low, recurrence can
occur even after 10 years. These data suggest that breast cancer subtypes are
associated with different pattern and time of recurrence and these factors should
be considered during treatment decision.

CONCLUSION
Knowing the subtype of breast cancer can help clinical practice to establish the
best treatment. Gene expression studies have shown heterogeneity of breast —
cancer, and this heterogeneity has a molecular basis; however, to date, it has not
been determined whether these molecular characteristics would influence
unequivocally the clinical management of breast cancer (52). The identification
of miRNAs and specific genes associated with breast cancer may reveal additional
heterogeneity among breast cancer subtypes and may become relevant in the
development of more specific drugs for each subtype, generating therapies that
give a longer life expectancy. Probably these studies will also help to detect cancer
in early stages, increasing the possibility of survival of patients. Molecular classification is useful not only in prognosis, but also for targeted therapy. Therefore, it
should be adopted as part of the routine histopathologic report.

INTRODUCTION
Surgery has been the essential component in the management of treatable breast
cancer since the first reports of radical mastectomy by William Stewart Halstead (1)
and Willy Myer (2) in 1894. With the use of standardized staging and data collection, evidence-based management of breast cancer has evolved to limit treatments
to what is necessary, but sufficient to allow tissue preservation and control of
treatment specific morbidity. An extreme example of this evolution might be the
treatment of focal ductal carcinoma in situ which would have been treated with
modified radical mastectomy in the 1960’s and might now be treated with simple
excision and hormone targeted oral therapy or in some cases observation alone.
The specific treatment regimens for breast cancer are currently directed by multidisciplinary teams involving integration of surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, plastic surgeons, and rehabilitation specialists. This
chapter focuses on specialized techniques employed in the surgical management
of breast cancer reflecting practice employed by various members of our
department.
In our current workflow, the patient’s diagnosis is confirmed microscopically
and characterized by histochemistry and biochemistry to identify the sub-type of
breast cancer and allow for directed treatment. After staging, customized therapy
is initiated that will depend on histology, molecular characterization (hormone
receptors, Her-2, Ki-67, genomic profile), patient age, and performance status.
For invasive breast cancer, surgical problems include localization of the tumor
for removal and determination of nodal status. As more tumors are discovered by
pretreatment imaging and are not identifiable on physical exam, intraoperative
tumor localization techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and
reliable. Currently, standard of care dictates localization of potentially involved
lymph nodes eliminating the need for axillary dissection in many patients.
Techniques for localization of “sentinel” nodes has become increasingly accurate
and technically less complicated. Surgical treatment may occur after pretreatment with systemic agents (neoadjuvant) or a part of reconstruction (oncoplastic
resection). Primary reconstruction of the breast is often performed at the time of
mastectomy. For patients requiring lymph node dissection, lymphatic reconstruction procedures may be part of the initial operation (lymph-venous reconstruction, S-lympha). In some cases, devices are placed to direct radiation to the
tumor bed at the time of initial surgery or intraoperative radiation is given for
select patients.

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

Post-surgical morbidity has become an increasing focus of concern as more
patients survive breast cancer with modern therapy. Two surgically addressable
causes are arm lymphedema and physical deformity post treatment. In one recent
study, long-term arm lymphedema occurred in 22.4% of patients after treatment
for breast cancer (3). This can be challenging to manage and causes significant
distress for the patient. Surgical correction of lymphedema offers a means of ameliorating this condition.
The cosmetic deformity is a significant cause of distress in many patients and
attributed to causing delay in seeking treatment and contributing to postoperative
depression (4, 5). Reconstruction techniques with autologous tissue or prosthetic
implants is offered with increasingly improved results and patient satisfaction.

TUMOR LOCALIZATION
With the introduction and now ubiquitous use of image screening of the breast for
early detection of breast cancer, more than 25% of breast cancers detected are
non-palpable requiring physical localization for biopsy or removal of lesions, and
in the case of breast malignancies, to achieve breast conservation (6). Wire localization was the earliest technique used, with positioning done with the aid of
mammogram, but now performed with ultrasound and MRI as well. Wire localization most often requires placement in the radiology department by a radiologist with subsequent transport to the operating room. The surgeon must then
mentally reconstruct a three-dimensional assessment of the location from the twodimensional images provided and is dependent on the skill of the radiologist to
position the wire correctly. Successful localizations can be limited by small lesions,
multiple lesions, lesions containing multiple calcifications and small specimens.
This two-step procedure on the day of surgery can wreak havoc with surgical
schedules (6–8). It is surprising that only 2.5% of localizations are unsuccessful.
In our experience, mispositioning or movement of the wire post placement are the
most vexing problems.
Radioactive seed localization (RSL) was an early alternative to wire localizations. This involved implant of an I125 titanium seed under image guidance at the
tumor site within 5–7 days of operation. A technetium 99-based device was subsequently introduced. The seed is localized during surgery with a handheld
gamma detection probe. Patient satisfaction and successful removal of target
lesions was reported to be equivalent or better than wire localization, but regulatory restrictions for ordering, transport, storage, and recovery of radioactive
devices along with the attendant infrastructure required to implement this program is considerable, especially in the face of other alternatives (9).
Currently, radiofrequency reflector devices (LOCalizer; SAVI scout) have
offered an effective solution to the problem of localizing non-palpable breast
lesions without the overhead of ionizing radiation devices (10, 11). The LOCalizer
radiofrequency identification system (RFID) can be placed up to 30 days prior to
surgery with image guidance. A dedicated portable unit is used to guide retrieval
of the RFID tag. The first reported use documented 100% recovery of the tag.
Comparison of the LOCalizer with the SAVI Scout showed similar efficacy with
both devices comparing operative times, tissue volume removed, margin

involvement and re-excision rates (12, 13). The SAVI Scout has reported limitations including device inactivation by electrocautery, signal interference and
nickel allergy (13). Our experience with the LOCalizer revealed problems with
seed migration, mal-positioning, and probe calibration.
The latest device approved for use in the United States is the Magseed, a ferromagnetic 1 x 5 mm steel alloy implant introduced through an 18G needle in the
preoperative period (generally 1–7 days prior to surgery). The seed is detected
using a proprietary probe that detects the seed after activation to a magnetic state.
Recovery of the seed has consistently been reported to be over 99% (14, 15).
Localization requires non-ferrous instruments and requires some initial training
with the probe. Pooled analysis of four studies showed the Magseed to be noninferior to wire guided localization without the problems inherent in the wire
technique. Personal experience (Weingrad) with over 150 Magseed guided localizations segmental resection of breast carcinomas and resection of other breast
lesions is consistent with those reported findings.

LYMPH NODE LOCALIZATION AND PROCEDURES
The majority of breast cancers (65%) are confined to the breast and have excellent
survival of 99% at 5 years (16). However, once the cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes, the survival drops significantly to 86% (17). As such, presence
of axillary lymph node metastases is one of the most significant prognostic factors
in breast cancer and a factor that is important to be addressed in the staging workup (18). Since Halsted first described radical mastectomy, axillary lymph node
dissection (ALND) has been accepted as a means to assess nodal burden while
providing regional disease control (19–21). However, given the significant
morbidity of this surgery including risk of lymphedema, which occurs in about
2–56% of patients (22), and injury to major neurovascular structures like the
thoracodorsal and long thoracic nerves, efforts were made to adopt an approach
that was as effective, but less morbid. In the mid-1990s, Giuliano and colleagues
showed that the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was effective at staging the
clinically node negative axilla while limiting the morbidity of the more extensive
axillary lymph node dissection. (23) Traditionally, this was performed by injecting 3 to 5 ml of 1% isosulfan blue vital dye (Lymphazurin, Hirsch Industries, Inc.,
Richmond, VA) into the breast tumor and surrounding parenchyma or into the
wall of the biopsy cavity and surrounding tissue if the malignancy was already
removed. Then an additional incision was made in the axilla to identify the sentinel node which was colored blue and excised. Additional approaches to this technique include using radioactive colloid peritumoral injection and detection with
an intraoperative gamma probe to remove the hottest lymph node and all lymph
nodes with 10% or more of the ex vivo count of the hottest node. Using this technique along with isosulfan blue dye reduced the false negative rate to 5.8% (24).
Additionally, if any suspicious palpable nodes are encountered, they should be
removed regardless of whether they are radioactive or have blue dye, as it is felt
that some nodes with a significant amount of tumor may not readily uptake the
tracer. Alternative approaches have been explored to identify the sentinel lymph
node, including injection of alternative tracer agents such as ICG, which is

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

injected in the breast and detected with a fluorescent imaging system. A metaanalysis of 12 studies has shown this method to be equally good if not better at
detecting sentinel nodes (25). Additionally, magnetic tracer agents (e.g., superparamagnetic iron oxide or SPIO) are oncologically safe and reliable technique to
identify sentinel nodes. This is performed by injecting SPIO into the subareola or
an intradermal location and detecting the uptake in the axilla with a handheld
magnetometer (26).
At present, SLNB is the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically
node-negative patients. When SLNB is performed, and axillary lymph nodes are
found to be negative, multiple studies have shown that no further surgery is
needed (27). If SLNB is positive, standard of care was to proceed with axillary
lymph node dissection (ALND). However, several studies show that ALND can
be safely omitted (27). This included the American College of Surgeons
Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial (28). This study showed that patients
with T1-T2 invasive primary breast cancer with clinically negative axilla, 1 or 2
sentinel lymph nodes containing metastases, and who had breast-conserving
surgery followed by whole-breast irradiation, had noninferior overall survival
outcomes if ALND was omitted (28). If a mastectomy is performed, and occult
metastases, or tumor cells in the lymph node are not seen on initial hematoxylin
and eosin examination, but found on further examination of the node, ALND
may also be omitted based upon the NSABP B-32 trial which showed that there
was a nonsignificant, lower overall survival (0.6%) in patients with occult
metastases (29). Likewise, studies have shown no benefit of ALND over its
omission for patients with primary tumors <5 cm in size and clinically nonpalpable axillary nodes who had SLNB with micrometastases (≤2 mm) according to
The International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) 23-01 trial (30). Of note,
this trial included patients who received Breast Conserving Surgery in addition to patients who underwent mastectomy (30). As for clinically T1-2 nodenegative breast cancer patients who undergo mastectomy and SLNB and are
found to have 1-2 SLN+ and receive axillary radiation therapy, ALND can be
omitted based upon the findings in AMAROS trial (31). This trial showed no
difference in overall and disease-free survival and a lower rate of lymphedema
in patients receiving axillary radiation instead of the ALND (11% vs 23%) (31).
All of the aforementioned studies were in patients who did not receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy. In patients who did receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
ACOSOG Z1071 showed that SLNB can be safely performed in cN1 patients, as
long as two or more SLNs are examined, as this practice keeps the false negative
rate to <10% (32). Of note, further analysis of this trial showed that there was
improved sentinel node identification when using both blue dye and radioactive
colloid (93.8%), compared to either blue dye alone (78.6%) or radioactive
colloid alone (91.4%) (33).
Follow-up studies showed that when the clipped node is identified and
retrieved, the false negative rate is further reduced (34). In the setting of surgery
after neoadjuvant systemic therapy, if any sentinel lymph nodes, clipped nodes,
wire-localized nodes, or palpable nodes have tumor in them, an axillary lymph
node dissection is indicated. In the event patients have more extensive axillary
nodal burden on imaging following neoadjuvant therapy, one should forgo axillary SLNB and proceed with ALND instead. Our practice is to still wire localize
clipped lymph nodes in this situation to guarantee its removal.

ONCOPLASTIC SURGERY
While the primary focus of breast surgery is providing maximal control of
malignancy, we recognize the importance of simultaneously optimizing aesthetic outcomes, and in turn improving quality of life, body image, and selfesteem of the patient. As such, oncoplastic surgery, which was first termed as
such in 1993, has been developed to try to achieve this goal. Some of the
approaches to achieve this in the setting of breast conserving surgery include
aesthetic placement of incisions, using either tissue remodeling or volume
replacement with distant tissue to reconstruct volume defects, de-epithelialization, and donut mastopexy (35, 36). Additionally, oncoplastic surgery
attempts to create symmetry between the two breasts. Attempts to do this
include mastopexy or a breast reduction technique at the time of breast conserving surgery. Fortunately, studies have shown this to be safe in regard to not
causing significant complications or delays to adjuvant therapy (37). As for
mastectomies, attempts to achieve these goals include nipple-sparing mastectomies, in which the whole breast and major ducts from within the nipple
lumen are removed, while saving the nipple areola complex dermis and epidermis (38). This is felt to be oncologically safe for patients, as shown in a
2018 systematic review comparing nipple sparing to skin sparing mastectomies and finding no statistically significant difference in 5-year disease-free
survival and mortality, and similar local recurrence rates (39). Of note, many
of the initial studies on this were performed on breasts with tumors that were
greater than 2 cm from the nipple areola complex; however, in our practice,
we do not find this to be a hard rule. We do make sure to remove a small periareolar biopsy to confirm that the residual retroareolar tissue is free of cancer
or DCIS. Nipple-sparing mastectomy has also been found to be safe and effective at preventing breast cancer in high-risk populations, including patients
with pathogenic BRCA mutations (40). Most surgeons will only offer nipple
sparing mastectomy to women with small to moderate sized breasts with minimal ptosis to reduce the risks of flap and nipple necrosis and prevent nipple
malposition (41), and to avoid this in patients with advanced disease, in
whom a complication associated with nipple necrosis would delay much
needed adjuvant therapy. Novel approaches to prevent this have been developed, including the surgical delay procedure in which the skin flap is created
extending beyond the nipple–areolar complex and surrounding mastectomy
skin by about 4–5 cm between 7–21 days prior to surgery. Of note, the tissue
at the nipple is sampled and sent for permanent section pathology, and if
negative, the patient returns for the completion of the nipple-sparing mastectomy (42). In the event the nipple cannot be saved, areolar-sparing mastectomy can be performed safely as well (43). If the cancer involves the nipple
areola complex, or the cancer is too locally advanced, or the patient’s breast
size and ptosis are not amenable to nipple-sparing approach, a skin-sparing
approach is performed. A skin-sparing mastectomy conserves more of the skin
flaps than the traditional mastectomy to allow for enough skin to be saved to
perform reconstruction after. Following surgery, various approaches can be
used to recreate the nipple areola complex.

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

INTRAOPERATIVE RADIATION
Over the last 30 to 50 years, with the validation of breast conservation therapy for
breast cancer (44, 45), radiotherapy has been established as part of the primary
treatment for resectable breast carcinoma, although there are reports documenting local radiotherapy for treatment of breast cancer dating back to 1937 (46).
Radiation therapy to all or the affected part of the breast is essential to minimize
local recurrence. Recently, in select cases, patients with low risk, hormone
­receptor-positive, node-negative tumors over the age of 70 have been found to not
benefit from treatment (47). With subsequent refinement of radiation delivery
protocols, select patients are eligible for accelerated partial breast irradiation
(APBI), which involves the delivery of radiation to limited volume of breast tissue
with shorter treatment protocols, resulting in fewer side effects and equivalent
treatment results (48). Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and an implant targeting device (BioZorb) are recent techniques that require surgical participation to
allow radiation delivery to restricted volumes.

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)
While there are currently multiple trials with various entry requirements comparing various methods of delivering APBI, single fraction IORT has already generated level-1 results from randomized trials comparing IORT to external beam
whole breast radiotherapy (49–52). The TARGIT-A trial demonstrated noninferiority of IORT compared to conventional whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT)
for patients who met the specific criteria for post pathology single dose therapy.
The ELIOT Trial had a similar design to TARGIT-A, but used mobile electron technology to deliver a single dose of 21 Gy. The ELIOT Trial had an unselected population for inclusion with no difference in overall survival. Risk factors associated
with a higher incidence of breast recurrence were identified. At our center, a low
energy ZEISS Intrabeam unit is used to deliver therapy. Patients are selected with
low-risk tumors and favorable demographics (Table 1). The surgeon fits an appropriately sized applicator in the tumor cavity after tumor excision. Confirmation
of clear margins of resection, negative sentinel nodes, and adequate depth is
determined by ultrasound. Tumor control, excellent cosmetic outcomes and low
risk of complications are the norm with a high degree of patient acceptance and
satisfaction (53).

BioZorb
The BioZorb is an implantable, bioabsorbable device in a spiral configuration fitted with titanium clips that serves as a radiotherapy target. It is secured in the
tumor cavity providing precise identification of the tumor site and offers partial
reconstitution of the excised volume of tissue. It is offered in multiple sizes and
two different shapes to fit nicely into various cavities. This allows for reduction in
planned target volumes for treatment. Some centers are using this for patients
who are receiving radiation boost to the tumor bed. Cosmetic outcomes over two
years are reported by Kaufman in his study of 818 patients (54) to be good to
excellent in over 87% of patients with adverse effects in 3.8% of patients (n = 31).
Our experience largely confirms what is reported (unpublished). There is a
“learning curve” for effective use of this device. The re-absorption can take up to
two years with persistence of a palpable presence of the device at the tumor site,
but with careful sizing of the implant this has rarely been an issue (55). Most of
our patients have been treated with APBI as opposed to targeted boost of the
tumor bed. Re-excision for involved margins is simplified because of the orientation of the device in the excision cavity. A retrospective review by Rashad et al.
discusses the issue of cost effectiveness of a BioZorb implant versus marking the
cavity with clips (56). Kaufman counters pointing the benefit of the BioZorb to
precisely target the tumor bed and decrease treatment volumes. He cites the
known inaccuracy in defining the tumor site with clips because of tissue distortion, rearrangement and clip movement. In some cases, we found the partial
restoration in lost tissue volume to markedly improve the cosmetic outcome
(e.g., upper inner and medial breast). Long term results are anticipated for this
new device.

BREAST RECONSTRUCTION
Treating breast cancer with a mastectomy resulting in the loss of a breast disrupts
the harmony of the feminine body structure which has the potential to cause dramatic effects on a woman’s self-identity affecting body image, psychosocial wellbeing, and sexual well-being (57–60). In 1998, The Women’s Health and Cancer
Rights Act (WHCRA), a federal law mandating all payer coverage with the opportunity to undergo breast reconstruction following mastectomy, was passed (60).
Since then, breast reconstruction has seen an increase by 75% between 2000 and
2020, with 137,808 breast reconstruction procedures performed in 2020 (61).
The goal of breast reconstruction is to recreate a breast mound to restore form and
psychosocial function (60). Considerable advances have been made in breast
reconstruction where the principles of both reconstructive and cosmetic surgery
have merged with the goal of optimizing patient outcomes and minimizing the
effects of a mastectomy.
Improved knowledge of breast anatomy and its circulation as well as advances
in mastectomy and reconstruction techniques have enhanced our ability to preserve the entire breast skin envelope and all of the breast subunits including the
nipple areola complex without sacrificing oncologic principles. In doing so, our
ability to restore the appearance of the native breast has improved considerably.

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

As previously mentioned, a nipple sparing mastectomy preserves the breast skin
envelope including the nipple areola complex. An appropriate candidate for a
nipple-sparing mastectomy is a patient with grade 1 or 2 ptosis and favorable
tumor findings (62–65). Incision locations are decided together between the
breast and reconstructive surgeons. Various factors, such as, cosmesis (inferolateral inframammary fold incision), optimal preservation of blood supply to the
nipple areola complex, surgeon’s experience on the technique (horizontal radial
incision), and breast ptosis and repositioning of the nipple areola complex (vertical incision), will determine the optimal placement of incisions (63, 65, 66).
Patients with breast hypertrophy or grade 3 ptosis may be considered for nipple
areola complex preservation if the mastectomy is risk reducing in the setting of a
genetic predisposition for breast cancer. This is best accomplished in a staged
fashion beginning with a Wise pattern breast reduction or mastopexy with a
superomedial pedicle followed by a mastectomy three months later. From an
oncologic perspective, predictors of nipple involvement include tumor-nipple
distance ≤ 1 cm, tumors > 3 cm in dimension, extensive DCIS component and
multicentricity; therefore, patients with these findings should not be considered
for a nipple sparing mastectomy (67).
Accounting for up to 75% of breast reconstruction following mastectomy in
the United States, prosthetic based reconstruction has several advantages compared to other reconstructive options including reduced operative time, rapid
recovery, avoiding surgical donor site morbidity, and ease of technique (68).
Prosthetic based breast reconstruction has seen substantial advancements in technology and technique over the last fifty years. When silicone breast implants were
first marketed in the 1960s, breast reconstruction was performed in the subcutaneous plane following a mastectomy. This technique was fraught with complications including capsular contracture, infection, and high explant rates (69, 70).
As a result, the approach to breast reconstruction shifted to placing the breast
prosthesis in the submuscular pocket, deep to the pectoralis major and serratus
anterior muscles, after studies demonstrated that breast augmentation with
silicone implants in a subpectoral pocket experience less capsular contracture.
Unfortunately, placement in this plane also contributed to increased discomfort
and a less natural appearing breast associated with animation deformity and
implant displacement. After acellular dermal matrix (ADM), a biologic mesh, was
introduced to the market in 2006, a dual plane strategy was incorporated into
breast reconstruction where the pectoralis major was detached from its origin
along the fifth and sixth ribs and the ADM is used as an inferior sling along the
inframammary fold and lateral breast footprint or merely serves as an extension to
the pectoralis muscle. ADM has been shown to decrease capsular contracture
rates and preferentially allows for lower pole fullness while allowing for more
control of the mastectomy pocket (70). While this technique is used today, the
pendulum appears to be swinging back to the pre-pectoral pocket. The development of highly cohesive silicone gel implants has reduced implant rippling while
providing a more ideal breast appearance with favorable soft contours when ADM
is utilized for soft tissue support. ADMs now come in multiple sizes, shape, and
thicknesses allowing for more options depending on the reconstructive strategy.
Alternative to ADMs include synthetic meshes including absorbable and permanent varieties (70–72). More studies are needed to evaluate the two types of mesh
in breast reconstruction.

Crystal J et al.

Several factors are taken into consideration whether to perform breast reconstruction in one stage or two stages. This is a decision that is made with the breast
surgeon and the patient. Factors that may influence this decision include breast
volume and degree of ptosis, expectation for a larger or smaller reconstructed
breast, and desire for limiting the number of operations. Furthermore, the quality
of a mastectomy flap may also contribute to the decision-making process. The
skin envelope should be evaluated intra-operatively assessing for thickness and
perfusion. If there is any concern about viability, intraoperative fluorescent angiography with indocyanine green may be utilized to assess for vascular inflow and
washout. While a single stage direct to implant reconstruction is becoming more
popular, two-stage prosthetic-based reconstruction remains the more common
strategy in the United States, beginning with placement of a tissue expander with
ADM followed by exchange for a permanent implant once adequately expanding.
The benefit of a two-stage approach is that a second operation provides another
opportunity to improve the aesthetic outcome whereas a one stage operation may
allow a patient to return to their life more quickly without the need for serial
expansion or a second operation.
While implant-based reconstruction is the more common approach to breast
reconstruction in the United States, patients tend to have higher satisfaction following autologous tissue reconstruction. Traditionally, autologous breast reconstruction was performed using pedicled flaps including the transverse rectus
abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps.
There were limitations with these options including flap volume, high rate of partial flap loss, and donor site morbidity. With improvements in technology including microsurgery instruments, operating microscopes, expertise with perforator
flaps as well as comfort with microsurgery technique, autologous tissue breast
reconstruction takes advantage of transplanting one’s own soft tissue from a distant site in the form of a free flap to reconstruct the breast. The most common
donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen whereby a muscle sparing
TRAM or deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is harvested. This donor
site is ideal as most women have excess lipodystrophy and skin laxity along the
abdominal wall. Venous microanastomoses are performed to the internal mammary vessels to restore flap circulation. The major complication is total flap loss
which has been reported to have a 2–5% risk (73, 74). Moreover, Chang (74) and
Baumann (75) et al. demonstrated that the risk of fat necrosis can be decreased as
the number of flap perforators are preserved in abdominally based autologous
tissue breast reconstruction. Alternative flaps can be used when the abdomen cannot be used as a donor site due to a history of an abdominoplasty or if the patient
is thin and additional soft tissue is needed to supplement the volume of the
abdominal flap. These donor sites include the thigh (gracillis myocutaneous flap,
profunda artery perforator flap), gluteal region (superior or inferior gluteal artery
perforator flap), and the lumbar region (lumbar artery perforator flap) (76–79).
Furthermore, for the patient who has previously undergone a mastectomy and has
an acquired absence of the breast associated with lymphedema, a DIEP flap may
be harvested with the superficial inguinal lymph nodes as a composite flap to
reconstruct both the breast and the lymphatic system. Approximately 3-4 lymph
nodes may be transferred with this adipofascial flap when it is harvested with the
superficial circumflex iliac artery and vein with the goal of restoring lymphatic
physiology (80). Lymph nodes are positioned in the axilla during flap inset.

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

These lymph nodes are dissected with great care, and it is recommended that they
be harvested with reverse mapping to avoid iatrogenic injury resulting in lower
extremity lymphedema (81, 82).
Secondary procedures to improve the final aesthetic outcome of the reconstructed breast may be offered. Fat grafting has become a common tool to treat
and correct a variety of defects that may not have been addressed during the initial breast reconstruction procedure (83). These defects may be intrinsic to the
reconstructed breast mound such as fat necrosis in an autologous breast flap or
rippling of an implant with an overlying thin mastectomy flap. Extrinsic defects
may be observed following radiation therapy or in the presence of scarring that
may cause a contour irregularity. Fat grafting may also be used to soften a sharp
transition between the reconstructed breast mound and the native chest wall,
referred to as a step off deformity. Alternatively, large volume and mega volume fat
grafting, defined as 100–300 cc and >300 cc/breast respectively, can be performed
to augment the volume of an already reconstructed breast (83). Complications of
fat grafting include cyst formation and fat necrosis both of which can be treated
easily. While it was once considered that fat grafting reduced the ability to detect
cancer on imaging, and increased cancer risk, more recent research has distinguished the evolutionary change of fat grafting from suspicious findings on mammographic imaging (84, 85). Moreover, Spear et al. has demonstrated the safety
and efficacy of fat grafting the reconstructed breast (86). Nipple reconstruction
and/or three-dimensional nipple areola complex tattooing can be offered to complete reconstruction of the aesthetic subunits of the breast.
A remaining challenge in breast reconstruction has been the ability to restore
sensation to the reconstructed breast. While evidence of neurotization in the
breast dates back to the early 1990s, it has only been recently that consistent and
reproducible results have been achieved. Peled et al. presented a new technique,
whereby coapting a nerve allograft (Avance Nerve Graft, Axogen, Jacksonville, FL)
using 8-0 or 9-0 nylon between the transected T4 or T5 lateral intercostal nerve
to the sub-areolar nerves, demonstrated light touch sensibility to the breast and a
two point discrimination of the nipple areola complex was preserved in immediate implant-based reconstruction without the associated morbidity of harvesting
an autologous nerve (87). Autologous flap neurotization has also demonstrated
that restoring sensation in autologous tissue-based reconstruction can be achieved
and provide patients with a positive impact on the quality of life according to the
BREAST-Q (88, 89).
Halsted wrote “Beware the man with the plastic operation” when he introduced the radical mastectomy for treatment of breast cancer in 1907 (19, 90). It is
because of advances in knowledge, technique, and technology that plastic and
reconstructive surgeons now have the ability to provide superior outcomes with
high patient satisfaction to those who have not only been diagnosed with cancer,
but also sustained the loss of a breast and perhaps a sense of self.

LYMPHATIC RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES
A common yet feared consequence of an ALND for metastatic breast cancer is
lymphedema. Secondary lymphedema is a pathologic condition characterized by

53

54

Crystal J et al.

insufficient drainage of interstitial fluid caused by a disruption in the lymphatic
vasculature involving the affected extremity. This condition may contribute to a
decrease in quality of life and results in symptoms of upper extremity pain, heaviness, swelling, skin tightness, and reduced range of motion. It raises psychosocial
concerns about one’s own body image and studies have shown that patients with
lymphedema also demonstrate higher levels of anxiety, depression, and fatigue (91).
Moreover, the development of lymphedema increases susceptibility to upper
extremity infections. Not only does lymphedema impose a considerable cost on
patients, but it also impacts our healthcare system with conservative management
accounting for $498 million annually ranking 13th among all treatments by the
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement (92).
The incidence of lymphedema has been shown to be 0–13% following sentinel
lymph node biopsy, 30% following an axillary lymph node dissection with even
higher rates following adjuvant radiation (91, 93–96). Traditionally, treatment has
consisted of physiotherapy and lifelong compression garments (97). More recently,
efforts have been made intraoperatively to reduce injury to the lymphatic system
draining the upper extremity and thus minimize the development of lymphedema.
Axillary reverse mapping, introduced in 2007, is a technique whereby blue dye is
injected along the subcutaneous tissue in the ipsilateral upper extremity prior to
performing an axillary lymph node dissection (98). Performing this technique
aids in identifying the upper extremity lymphatic anatomy with the potential of
preserving it during an axillary lymph node dissection and subsequently reducing
lymphedema risk. Unfortunately, this technique does not eliminate the risk of
lymphatic system injury. Nor should oncologic resection be compromised to
reduce the risk of lymphedema (91).
In 2009, Boccardo et al. described the first efforts in performing immediate
lymphatic reconstruction following an axillary lymph node dissection (99). Using
a technique referred to as Lymphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach
(LYMPHA), lymphovenous bypasses were performed between divided lymphatic
channels draining the upper extremity to tributaries from the axillary vein, in
essence re-routing lymphatic drainage and restoring physiologic lymphatic flow.
A follow-up study at four years following axillary surgery demonstrated a 4%
incidence of lymphedema with immediate lymphatic reconstruction that increased
to 10% if patients who experienced transient lymphedema were included (100).
Feldman et al. attempted immediate lymphatic reconstruction in 37 women with
successful completion in 27 patients (101). They reported 8% risk of lymphedema in patients 24 months after immediate lymphatic reconstruction and
12.5% risk of transient lymphedema. They were unable to perform LYMPHA in
10 patients due to lack of a suitable recipient vein, inability to identify a lymphatic
channel, and extensive axillary disease. More recently, Johnson et al. also demonstrated promising results in a cohort of 97 women who underwent immediate
lymphatic reconstruction at the time of axillary surgery with an incidence of 3.1%
after a median follow up time of 11.4 months (102).
Patients with breast cancer and metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes requiring axillary lymph node dissection and potentially adjuvant radiation may be
identified as high risk for developing lymphedema and are referred from the surgical oncologist to a plastic and reconstructive surgeon with microsurgical training for preoperative evaluation for immediate lymphatic reconstruction. Evaluation
will include obtaining both subjective and objective set of measurements to

Current Surgical Innovations Treatment Breast Cancer

establish a baseline preoperatively. A validated lymphedema-specific patient
reported outcome using the 18-question Lymphedema Life Impact scale version 2
that answers questions across four domains including physical, psychosocial, and
functional concerns is completed by the patient. Bioimpedance spectroscopy
(L-Dex; ImpediMed, Carlsbad, CA) provides objective information regarding the
amount of fluid and fat distribution and the ability to detect early changes in
extracellular fluid compartments in the affected extremity. Volume distribution
using a perometer (optoelectric volumetry) is yet another instrument used to evaluate lymphedema (103).
Intra-operatively, the surgical oncologist and reconstructive surgeon will work
together to determine the optimal incision location, which generally tends to be
high along the axilla. However, in certain circumstances, the axilla can also be
approached through a mastectomy incision. The surgical oncologist will perform
reverse axillary mapping with the injection of lymphazurin blue dye intradermally
into the upper medial arm before proceeding with the axillary lymph node​
dissection. Attention is paid to identifying and preserving lymphatic channels
draining the arm with as much length as possible. It is also critical to preserve
axillary vein branches with a suitable length (6–7 cm) found within level one and
level two of the axilla, specifically targeting the thoracoepigastric vein, lateral thoracic vein, medial pectoral vein, and branches emanating from the thoracodorsal
vein, if possible, from an oncologic perspective (104). If neither of these veins
have been preserved, an unnamed vein could be used if it is found within proximity to the lymphatic vessel or alternatively a vein graft could be used. Ideally, the
recipient vein should have a competent valve to prevent back bleeding.
Once the ablative component has been performed, the reconstructive microsurgeon will inject indocyanine green intradermally in the medial upper arm
and use near infrared fluorescence imaging including SPY Elite and Phi (Stryker
Inc., USA) to aid in locating lymphatic channels draining the upper extremity
that have been transected in the axilla. Others have advocated the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate to map the extremity lymphatic system (91, 105). After
the vein and lymphatic channel have been dissected free, a surgical microscope
will be introduced into the field and used to prepare the vessels for microanastomosis by stripping them free of adventitia and trimming the edges.
Specialized microsurgery instruments are used to handle the delicate tissues. In
general, due to a size mismatch between lymphatic vessel and recipient vein,
most lymphovenous bypasses in the axilla will be performed in an end-to-end
fashion using an intussusception technique whereby the lymphatic vessel is
telescoped into the vein and temporarily secured using 9-0 nylon with a U-stitch
(99, 104). Interrupted sutures are then placed from the vein edge to the lymphatic adventitia circumferentially until a good seal is achieved. The temporary
U-stich is then removed, and patency of the anastomosis is assessed using a strip
test, confirmation of blue dye in the vein, or use of SPY to evaluate ICG across
the anastomosis. A 15F drain is usually placed in the axilla and removed when
output is sufficiently low.
An alternative has been proposed for patients that do not have access to microsurgeons who perform LYMPHA. Simplified LYMPHA (S-LYMPHA) is another
approach to immediate lymphatic reconstruction and should be considered when
use of a microsurgical technique is not available (106, 107). Following immediate
lymphatic reconstruction, the patient is referred to a certified lymphedema

55

56

Crystal J et al.

therapist for education and range of motion exercises. They are also monitored
closely for the development of lymphedema. LLISv2 is completed, LDEX and/or
perometry values are obtained every three months for the first 3 years, every
6 months for years 4 and 5, and annually thereafter (108). These measures are
compared to the patient’s baseline measurements. In the event that immediate
lymphatic reconstruction cannot be performed or with the development of lymphedema, other procedures to restore lymphatic physiology such as distal lymphovenous bypasses or vascularized lymph node transplant can be offered. Johnson
and colleagues performed a cost utility analysis that demonstrate that the addition
of LYMPHA to patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection with or without adjuvant radiation is cost effective (109). Moving forward, further investigation is warranted that standardizes technique and outcome measures.

CONCLUSION
Over the past hundred plus years, treatment for breast malignancy has progressed
from physical ablations to evidence-based multidisciplinary care directed at the
systemic nature of the disease and the effect of treatment. As discussed here, the
current focus is towards tissue preservation, restoration of physical function and
appearance achieved through de-escalation of treatment or reconstruction of lost
function. We have discussed some of the innovations that are part of our current
practice that have altered the treatment of breast cancer. These are surgical procedures using imaging modalities to localize and define the extent of tumors, positioning of therapeutic devices for novel delivery of radiotherapy, reconstruct
breast lost to disease and physically restore lymphatic drainage.

Abstract: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) presents as swelling in the
arm, hand, trunk, or breast at varying times after completion of breast cancer
treatment. The reported incidence of BCRL varies widely in part due to its dependence on the type and extent of the treatment, pre-treatment risk factors, and the
criteria used to define its presence. Central to this issue are the various quantitative measures that are used to specify lymphedema thresholds for its detection
and tracking over time and during treatment. The goal of this chapter is to discuss
these issues and the methods available for the non-invasive quantitative assessment of BCRL. Operational principles, advantages and limitations of the various
methods, their clinical history of use, and effectiveness are discussed. Covered
methods include those used to assess and monitor lymphedema-related changes
in tissue water at any anatomical site and also methods used to assess changes
only in limbs.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) has a variable reported incidence that
depends on the objective criteria used and, on the type and extent of a patient’s
treatment (1–5). When BCRL occurs, it manifests itself as increased fluid anywhere in the at-risk arm (6–8) or thorax (9, 10) or other areas. Most portable and
readily accessible noninvasive methods that assess its presence and extent are
restricted to those that measure arm size change or the difference between at-risk
arm and contralateral arms. These methods include manual (11–13) and automated (8, 14–16) circumference and volume measurements, arm fluid changes
assessed by electrical impedance (17–19), and volume changes assessed by water
displacement measurements (WDM). These are discussed after a brief description
of BCRL incidence, and the factors affecting it. Subsequently, a fully portable measurement method, used to assess localized lymphedema at any anatomical site via
tissue dielectric constant measurements (20–24) is described. Other non-invasive
methods, including photographic and scanning methods (25–27), magnetic resonance imaging (28, 29), and ultrasound (30–32) are also briefly discussed.

BCRL INCIDENCE
BCRL presents as swelling in the arm, hand, trunk, or breast after breast cancer
treatment that, among other more serious outcomes, causes discomfort, distress,
disability and anxiety (33). Factors that influence the incidence of BCRL depend
on tumor stage, body mass index, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), number of nodes dissected, axillary radiation, surgery type (34), and the diagnostic
criteria used.
BCRL incidence is about 20% at one year and 40% at ten years post-treatment
(35–37). Thus, at least one in five female breast cancer survivors will develop
BCRL. According to a meta-analysis (36), BCRL incidence was 10.3% between
3–6 months post-surgery, 13.8% between 6–12 months, 18.9% between 12–24
months, 18.6% between 24–60 months, and 15.6% beyond 60 months. BCRL is
more prevalent in stage III and stage IV breast cancer since more nodes are generally removed (38, 39). A 15-year prospective study found that 24% of early (stage I
and II) and 35.3% of advanced (stage III and IV) breast cancer patients were diagnosed with BCRL (39). Increased body mass index is another important risk factor for BCRL, with obese patients being almost twice as likely to develop BCRL
(36, 38, 40, 41).
When comparing the two main surgical treatment options, mastectomy and
lumpectomy, breast cancer survivors who had a mastectomy are more likely to get
BCRL (38) with incidence reported as 24–49% among mastectomy survivors, and
4–28% among lumpectomy survivors (42). Survivors who had lymph node dissection, with or without axillary radiation, had an increased risk for BCRL (38, 39, 43).
BCRL among survivors who had both ALND and radiation was 41%, and in those
who did not have radiation, it was 17% (43). BCRL also occurs following sentinel
lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without ALND (36, 44). BCRL incidence in breast cancer survivors who had only SLNB was 11.5% but was 39.7% in those with both

Measuring Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema

SLNB and ALND (44). Increased incidence of BCRL is greater with ALND (36, 45, 46)
and with more nodes removed. Removing 1–5 nodes was not a significant risk factor for BCRL whereas BCRL was 5-times more likely if 6–15 nodes were removed,
and 10-times more likely if 16 or more nodes were removed (47).

ARM VOLUMES BASED ON MANUAL CIRCUMFERENCE
MEASUREMENTS
The circumference of the non-compressed and relaxed arm is measured with a
tape-measure that is optimally pulled with a constant tension using a springloaded calibrated tape measure at all measured sites (Figure 1). Practical measurement issues include the number of circumferential measurements to be made,
their longitudinal separation, the volume calculation model, and how the volumes or circumferences are optimally used to assess initial lymphedema status
and its subsequent change due to either time or therapy.

Measurement Details and Volume Calculations
The preceding measurement issues have been investigated in healthy and lymphedematous arms. Casley-Smith was among the first to systematically study these
issues (48). An approach was to calculate segment volumes (VS) between two
circumferences (c1,2) separated by a distance L using a truncated cone model as
VS = L/(12p) × [c12 + c1 c2 + c22). The formula was used in 150 unilateral BCRL
patients with circumferences measured at mid-hand, narrowest part of the wrist,
and at 10 cm intervals starting from the middle fingertip. By summing segment

circumference is pictured being measured with a tape measure that is equipped with a
tension gauge so that measurements at multiple arm sites are made with uniform tension. If
two longitudinal separated sites have their circumferences measured the volume of the limb
between these segments can be reliably calculated using geometric formulas.

volumes, arm volumes of interest were determined. Percentage edema volume
(%EV) was calculated as the volume difference between affected and contralateral
arms divided by contralateral arm volume. The %EV determined this way was
compared to edema volumes determined via water displacement (%EVW), considered as the gold-standard. A high correlation between methods was reported
(r = 0.925) with a regression equation %EV = 1.096 %EVW + 0.007. These authors
suggested that rather than using a truncated-cone model, a summation-of-disks
model might be better (49).
Measurements in 15 BCRL patients compared segment lengths of 10-cm vs.
about 4-cm in which the 4-cm start was the most distal portion of the wrist and
the end at about 45 cm (13). Calculated %EV was similar for both, but shorter
segments had a statistically greater %EV that was most evident at greater arm volumes and had better accuracy. The circumference-volume method was also compared to WDM on 14-women with unilateral BCRL using 4-cm segment
lengths (12). Small differences in arm volumes were reported depending on
method, but inter-arm differentials were highly correlated (r = 0.79). A subsequent reliability and validity study compared the circumference-volume method
with WDM on 66 women in which 19 had unilateral BCRL (50). Measured arm
length was standardized to start at the wrist (mid-ulnar styloid) and extend to
65% of the distance from olecranon (elbow) to acromion (shoulder tip).
Circumferential measurements were made at specified anatomical sites or standardized distances, with four segments used to calculate volume and compared to
WDM. Results indicated good correlation between methods but based on limits of
agreement, the methods could not reliably be interchanged since calculated volumes were up to 5% greater than WDM values. Based on reliability analyses they
concluded that the minimal detectible change in volume that could be used as a
clinical threshold representing a real change due to time or treatment was 150 ml.

LIMB VOLUMES FROM AUTOMATED ARM CIRCUMFERENCE
MEASUREMENTS
Automation of manual circumference measurements emerged with the arrival of a
device commercially known as the Perometer. Its basic operating principle is illustrated in Figure 2.

Measurement Details and Volume Calculations
A sliding frame with imbedded infrared (IR) light sources scans the arm and the
“shadow” dimensions D1 and D2 are detected and used calculate cross-sectional
areas as a constant (k) multiplied by D1 and D2. Segment volumes are determined
similarly to the manual method with segment volumes summed to produce the arm
volume of interest. This method has the advantage of rapidly estimating cross-­
sectional areas using as low as 0.5 cm segment lengths and an automatic calculation
of arm volumes. Disadvantages include device set-up, space requirements, patient
positioning, service maintenances and initial cost as compared manual methods.
Initial evaluations on 17 lymphedematous arms indicated an arm volume
6.8 ± 4.3% greater than manual tape-measure values (16). Subsequent tests on

Figure 2. Illustrating automated optoelectronic measurement of arm circumferences. A limb
(arm or leg) is placed within a movable frame that contains infrared light sources that
illuminate the limb and allow acquisition of limb projected perpendicular dimensions D1 and
D2. From these measurements the cross-sectional area of the limb slices is calculated for
slices of about 2 mm in length. The sum of these slices is used to calculate the limb volume.

37 lymphedematous arms compared automated volumes vs. tape-measure (5-cm
intervals) vs. WDM (51). Reproducibility of each method was assessed as satisfactory with inter and intra-class correlation coefficients ranging from 0.937 to
0.997. Repeated measurements by the same rater (intra-rater variation) yielded
volume percentage differences of 1.5 ± 1.4% for the Perometer, 2.9 ± 2.9% for
WDM and 3.2 ± 4.6% for the tape-measure method. Using perometry to pre-­
operatively screen 1028 women with unilateral BCRL emphasized the importance
of pre-surgical volumes (15). Perometer measurement utility for pre-operative
screening and follow-up in large volume centers is supported by findings in which
large numbers of patients have been evaluated (8, 15). Perometer usefulness to
assess hand volume was evaluated in 20 patients with hand lymphedema and
20 without lymphedema and compared to values determined using WDM (52).
It is unclear what calculation method was used but an approximate Perometer
volume overestimate of about 7.5% was reported. Other methods to estimate
hand volume not requiring sophisticated systems have been reported (53, 54) as
well as methods based on bioimpedance spectroscopy (55–57).

BCRL THRESHOLDS BASED ON ARM DIFFERENTIALS
OR CHANGES
Beyond clinical assessments and patient symptoms, various quantitative parameters have been developed to help define BCRL presence in its early subclinical
stage and later clinical stage. Parameters based on arm metrics were the earliest
and remain in use now, but other methods such as bioimpedance and tissue
dielectric constant measurements are now also available as discussed later in this
chapter.

Metric Thresholds
Most BCRL cases are unilateral, so it is common to compare at-risk arms to contralateral arms with respect to inter-arm differentials. Arm circumferences are
measured bilaterally at corresponding anatomical sites and inter-arm circumferences, or inter-arm volumes compared. Untreated BCRL progresses in volume and
grade rapidly at first and slowly thereafter (48). Untreated BCRL, quantified as
inter-limb volume ratios (VR), increased by 40.6% in the first year, 12.4% from
year one to five, and 4.22% from five to 30 years (58). Problems of BCRL measurements and accurate BCRL incidence assessments were raised by early investigators (59) and parameter values that best reflect BCRL presence were studied by
comparing three lymphedema thresholds based on arm metric measurements
(60). Arm circumferences were tape-measured at 4-cm intervals and also measured by perometry prior to breast surgery and at 6 and 12-months post-surgery
in 110 breast cancer survivors. Incidence was assessed in three ways based on
at-risk arms vs. contralateral arms, 2-cm circumference change at any site, and
200 ml volume change and 10% volume change. These thresholds yielded quite
different estimated one-year incidence rates of 46%, 24%, and 8%, respectively.
Further study on 236 patients followed for up to 5-years (5) indicated the
2-cm difference predicted a 94% incidence whereas the 10% volume difference
criterion predicted a 45% incidence. More recently, 1100 women with breast cancer who had ALND were followed for up to 5-years (8). BCRL thresholds used in
this multicenter study were a relative arm volume increase of ≥10% (Perometer
determined) and an L-Dex value (8, 14) >10 based on bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). By 24 months, 22.8% had BCRL based on volume but 45.6% had it
based on L-Dex. Early detection of relative volume increases between 5–10% were
strong predictors of BCRL occurring by 36 months. Analyses of the primary study
data (61) indicated a median time to develop BCRL was 11.3 months. For women
followed to 5 years (n = 156), 31.9% had BCRL as assessed by volume, whereas
77.2% had BCRL according to the 200 ml threshold.

BCRL ASSESSMENTS BASED ON WATER DISPLACEMENT
METHODS
WDM is considered by many to be the “gold standard” for volume measurements
(50, 62, 63). Insertion of the arm into a water-filled volumeter causes a water
volume equal to the inserted arm volume to be displaced and captured as overflow. Although accurate, the method is time-consuming and messy and depends
on patient mobility to implement and is not routinely used in clinic. However, it
can provide comparisons against which other methods may be assessed and provide reference values against which BCRL thresholds are developed. Absolute arm
volume thresholds are most useful if pre-surgery values are not available.

Water Displacement BCRL Thresholds
Using WDM, arm volumes were measured in 112 women (50.6 ± 18.2 years) with
a BMI of 24.5 ± 3.9 Kg/m2 (64). Most were right-handed (n = 100) with right arm

Measuring Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema

volumes about 3% greater than the left. Such handedness differences should be
taken into account. Prediction equations extrapolating back to what an arm volume would have been prior to BCRL may be applied based on normative values.
For right-handed women, right arm volume (RAV) in terms of left arm volume
(LAV) can be expressed as RAV = 0.979 LAV + 96.66 ml. Contrastingly, for LAV of
right-handed women the relationship is LAV = 0.991 RAV – 33.3 ml. In each case,
a 95% confidence interval was about 148 ml. It was suggested that the equations,
together with upper confidence limits, be used for thresholds.
As an example, consider a right-handed woman with a left arm at-risk who has
a measured RAV of 3000 ml. Her normal (predicted) LAV is 2940 ml to which is
added 148 ml resulting in a 2SD threshold of 3088 ml and an inter-arm ratio of
1.029. Contrastingly, if the right-arm were at-risk with the left arm measured at
3000 ml, the predicted threshold is 3182 ml with an inter-arm ratio of 1.06.
Inter-arm differentials of 200 ml, determined by WDM, were used as a threshold defining sustained BCRL in 85 women 24 months post-surgery (65).
Accordingly, 19 (22.4%) had BCRL at 24 months. Contrastingly, based on two
inter-arm circumference measurements made at 6 months post-surgery differing
by ≥ 2 cm, the calculated probability of sustained BCRL at 24 months was 60%.

BCRL ASSESSMENTS WITH BIOIMPEDANCE
SPECTROSCOPY (BIS)
BIS refers to measuring electrical impedance at multiple frequencies. This method
is widely used but it has been argued that it is not a proper substitute for volumes
or for localized assessments of limb lymphedema and is also not applicable to
other body areas (49). Contrastingly, it has been argued that it should be adopted
as a gold standard (66). In some quarters it has become common to use a surrogate parameter called the L-Dex (67). There is some controversy whether this
parameter and its threshold for BCRL is adequate (68).

BIS Measurement Details
Application of a sinusoidally varying voltage causes a time-varying current that
depends on frequency and the current’s pathway (Figure 3A). At low frequencies,
cell membranes pass little or no current due to the membrane’s high electrical
capacitance whereas at high frequencies current passes through the cell. As a consequence, the composite pathway may be represented by an equivalent electrical
circuit (Figure 3B). The quantities Re and Ri represent external and internal electrical resistances. These resistance values are inversely related to the amounts of
extracellular water (ECW) and intracellular water (ICW) through which the currents flow. Because of the low electrical resistance of body fluids relative to other
body components such as fat and connective tissue, the overall measured impedance (Z), which is the ratio of the voltage difference (V) to current (I), is strongly
dependent on fluid content. A schematized version of the measurement of arm
impedance is shown in Figure 3C in which electrodes are illustrated in accordance
with previously evaluated positioning (69).

frequency currents do not well penetrate cells due to the membrane capacitance whereas
high frequency currents do penetrate allowing for an estimate of intra and extracellular
water. B, An approximate equivalent electrical circuit depicting the various elements of the
cellular and extra-cellular current pathways. C, Illustrates one configuration of the way in
which the excitation and measuring electrodes are applied. The current (I) flows as indicated
in the dashed pathway and the voltage difference is measured as V. From these values the
arm impedance Z is calculated as the ratio of V/I.

In Figure 3A, the applied voltage (red lines) causes an exciting current to flow
(dashed lines). Right arm impedance is determined by the ratio of V (between
right and left hands) divided by current (I). In practice, it is possible to separate
components attributable to ICW and ECW. In assessing BCRL the concept is that
excess arm fluid causes the affected arm to have a reduced impedance vs. a presurgery baseline or vs. the contralateral arm. Devices are available for such measurements (Impedimed Ltd, Brisbane, Australia). One version (model SFB7) uses
256 frequencies that range between 3–5 KHz (low frequency) to 1000 KHz (high
frequency). Use of multiple frequencies allows extrapolations to evaluate theoretical zero and infinite frequencies based on Cole-Cole plots (70, 71) that describe
resistance vs. reactance as a function of frequency (72). These yield estimates of
ECW and ICW.
To determine changes only in ECW, which is the dominant fluid change compartment associated with lymphedema, multiple frequencies are much less important and a single frequency of less than 30 KHz (73) may be sufficient. An excellent
correlation between single frequency and BIS--determined values was obtained
for frequencies ≤ 50 KHz (74). However, whether using single or multiple frequencies, such measurements may not capture the full lymphedema picture
because of a non-measured contribution of bound water (75, 76). Some BIS technology is now incorporated in a system allowing BIS measurements while
standing.

Measuring Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema

BCRL Thresholds Based on BIS
Impedance measurements have been used for many years with applications ranging from studying peripheral vasculature (77) to cardiac assessments with impedance cardiography (78). However, its early description in the assessment of
lymphedema can be traced to the early-to mid-1990’s (79, 80). BCRL thresholds
were originally based on inter-limb impedance ratios obtained in healthy persons
(dominant/non-dominant) arms, with thresholds defined as inter-arm impedance
ratios (contralateral/at-risk) exceeding a mean ratio + 3SD as determined in 60
healthy women (81). The mean and SD of this healthy ratio was 0.964 ± 0.034
that led to a threshold of 1.066. Strictly speaking, this threshold applies to detecting BCRL in women in whom their dominant arm was at-risk. An adjustment to
this threshold ratio made for women whose at-risk arm was their non-dominant
arm was reported as 1.139 (82). The use of the 3SD threshold is arbitrary but
represents a conservative estimate that yields a better sensitivity. This threshold
was refined from measurements in 172 healthy women in which dominant/nondominant impedance ratios were 0.986 ± 0.040 yielding a threshold of 1.106.

BCRL ASSESSMENTS BASED ON TISSUE DIELECTRIC
CONSTANT (TDC)
The term tissue dielectric constant (TDC) was coined in 2007 (24) to represent the
value of the relative permittivity of skin-to-fat tissue measured in vivo using the
open-ended coaxial line method (83–85). To assess edema or lymphedema, it’s
use is based on the fact that its value strongly depends on tissue water content
(86–88). In contrast to lymphedema assessment methods useful only for limbs,
TDC measurements are localized and usable to measure skin water or skin-to-fat
water at most anatomical sites including breast (20, 89) and trunk (9, 90). Tissue
dielectric properties are dependent on their water content and use of the Debye
relationship can describe frequency dependence of tissue dielectric properties
(91, 92). In this formulation the real part of a complex permittivity (e*) is denoted
as e’ and its ratio to a vacuum’s permittivity (e’/e0) is relative permittivity (er).
From a physical perspective, tissue permittivity may be thought of as the electric
flux density (D) produced when the tissue experiences an applied electric field
(E). In this formulation, the permittivity or TDC may be defined as the ratio of the
flux density produced to the electric field causing it (e’ = D/E).

TDC Measurement Details
TDC is measured by touching the skin with a probe that has concentric inner and
outer electrodes (conductors) that functions as an open-ended coaxial line
(Figure 4A-top). The probe inserts a 300 MHz electric field from a battery-operated
control box or within the probe itself for a compact version (Figure 4B-bottom).
One of the multiprobe types is shown in Figure 4B-top. For both, a time-varying
electric field penetrates the tissue (Figure 4A-bottom). For a given frequency, the
depth of penetration depends on the probe’s radial dimensions (93, 94) with
larger diameter probes penetrating deeper (95). Some incident electromagnetic

hand-held device.

energy is reflected (Figure 4C) and from an analysis of this component, TDC is
determined via algorithms based on the physics of the process (85).
Devices are available (Delfin Technologies, Kuopio, Finland) that provide
probes for effective measurement depths between 0.5 mm and 5.0 mm (multiprobe system) or fixed depths (compact versions). In some tissues, TDC values
depend on measurement depth because of depth-dependent tissue heterogeneity (96, 97). Increased fat with increasing depth tends to lower the TDC value
due to low water content of fat (87, 98). Variations in TDC values are also
expected based on sex (99–101), age (102, 103), body habitus (104), and at
different anatomical sites along the arm (105, 106). These normal biological
variations do not importantly impact TDC use as a lymphedema assessment
method because of various normalization processes. For unilateral BCRL, interarm (107, 108) or inter-trunk (9, 10) or inter-breast (20, 109) ratios are used
with the added advantage that specific localized targets can be tracked. The
method permits assessing head-and-neck-related lymphedema (110) and lower
extremity lymphedema (111, 112) based on individualized inter-site
normalizations.

BCRL Thresholds Based on TDC
TDC measurements to a depth of 2.5 mm in 30 healthy pre- and 30 post-menopausal women yielded an inter-arm TDC ratio of 1.040 ± 0.040 vs. 1.640 ± 0.300

Measuring Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema

in 18 patients with BCRL (24). In that study, no healthy control had an inter-arm
ratio as great as 1.200 and no patient had a ratio as low as 1.200. It was suggested
that an inter-arm TDC-ratio of 1.200 should be a BCRL threshold-value. Had they
used a threshold based on 3SD greater than the mean, it would have been 1.160.
Other work supported the 1.200 threshold ratio (113). Inter-arm TDC-ratios
were compared between 60 healthy women and 30 patients with unilateral BCRL
(114). The healthy group’s inter-arm TDC-ratio (dominant/non-dominant) was
1.006 ± 0.085 with a 3SD TDC-threshold-ratio of 1.26. This was initially used to
define arm BCRL and were insignificantly affected by patient body mass index,
age, measurement depth (96, 108) or hand-dominance (115). Subsequent interside measurements made with a compact-type TDC device in 112 breast cancer
survivors without BCRL had at-risk to contralateral side ratios for forearm, upper
arm and middle lateral thorax of 1.00 ± 0.09, 1.01 ± 0.15, and 1.06 ± 0.10,
respectively (90). These ratios differed from those similarly measured in 78 breast
cancer survivors diagnosed with BCRL in whom corresponding inter-side ratios
were 1.29 ± 0.36, 1.25 ± 0.41, and 1.07 ± 0.12, respectively (90). In this study,
time since breast surgery was 8.4 ± 6.7 years with 12.8 ± 8.7 nodes removed. The
non-BCRL control patients were 6.9 ± 6.7 years post-surgery and had 6.1 ± 7.3
nodes removed. Based on a 3SD threshold for control ratios, an inter-arm BCRL
threshold may be calculated as 1.27, 1.46 and 1.36 for forearm, upper arm and
thorax. A slightly lower thorax-to-thorax inter-side ratio of 1.38 has been reported
from measurements on 120 women awaiting breast cancer surgery (10). A reference range for inter-hand TDC ratios has been determined via measurements in
70 healthy women to be 1.326 (116).

IMAGING-BASED MEASUREMENT METHODS
There have been several reports describing efforts to use 3-D photography and
whole-body scanning systems to assess arm volumes (25–27, 117–120). Future
progress in these areas is likely but currently are probably not suitable for routine
clinical application. Ultrasound provides an additional potential diagnostic
modality. It has been used to detect changes in cutaneous water (121, 122) and
thickness changes (32, 123) and, when used in combination with shear wave
elastography (124–126), shows promise to assess BCRL features based on cutaneous and subcutaneous dermal thickening and stiffness increases detectable by
increased shear-wave velocity resulting from an increased shear modulus.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another imaging modality with potential
efficacy in characterizing aspects of BCRL. A recent study used a multi-echo spin
echo protocol to evaluate T2-relaxation times in upper arms of women with and
without BCRL (127). On the basis that these T2 values reflect relative tissue fluid
content, a 7–13% greater fluid amount in BCRL arms was reported. However,
major limitations of MRI include its cost and accessibility and the absence of currently defined diagnostic threshold criteria. Another promising approach is that of
non-contrast magnetic resonance lymphography (NMRL) that visualizes lymphatic vessels (128, 129) for which a partial scoring system has recently been
suggested (130). However, as with any MRI-related approach, cost, required
patient time for measurement, and availability are major limitations when

73

compared with the portable hands-on methods of measurement previously discussed. However, MRI-related procedures can valuably add to the understanding
of lymphatic physiology and pathophysiology as in BCRL.

CONCLUSION
It has been long recognized (48, 49) that in addition to changes in interstitial fluid
content accompanying developing lymphedema, there are progressive changes in
tissue content, structure, and physical properties. Such changes include increases
in arm fat, muscle, and bone as has been demonstrated via dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) in a group of 18 women with BCRL (131). It is thus likely
that such complex changes, that do contribute to arm volume increases, will not
directly be reflected as decreases in measured arm impedance. These complexities
have been more recently investigated using MRI (132) in which excess fat volume
was observed in both intra- and inter muscular compartments of seven patients
with BCRL. An increasing relative amount of fat accumulation would increase
measured arm impedance even though arm volume was increasing further suggesting a limitation to BIS tracking in such cases. Other factors to be considered
relevant to BCRL portable or semi-portable measurement techniques is their relative initial cost, continuing supply needs and operating costs, maintenance needs,
ease of use, and difficulties with measurement. Based on such considerations, the
relatively non-portable Perometer system cost (350NT) of at least $33,000 may be
most useful for high volume screening facilities. Contrastingly, the hand-held
TDC device, costing about $4000 with no subsequent operating costs, may be
most useful for rapid routine physician or therapist initial detection and follow-up
assessments of localized BCRL or for such measurements at any other anatomical
site related to BCRL such as breast or thorax. Use of BIS may also be most useful
for high volume screening and follow-up purposes in which sensitivity to smallto-moderate free and bound water increases are not important. Initial unit cost is
about $8000 with a continuing electrode cost per patient. A comparison between
BIS and TDC methods in 100 women with BCRL has reported TDC having a
greater sensitivity at detecting early lymphedema (133). This is in part due to
lymphedema that is more superficial. They also suggest complementary use of
TDC and volume assessments and indicate a number of practical advantages of
TDC. These are reported to include the contradictory use of BIS in patients who
are pregnant, have pacemakers or metal implants and patients being in contact
with a metal surface. However, a case has been put forward that BIS should be
considered as a gold standard for assessing limb lymphedema (66) and a summary of historical estimates of its sensitivity and specificity have recently been
reported (18). From the point of view of cost, tape measure procedures with volume conversion and limb volumes via water displacement require the least for
equipment, but measurement time and patient acceptance need to be considered.
Tape measurements are well accepted by patients but may require extended therapist measurement time. In the case of water-displacement measurements, patient
positioning and discomfort as with all methods are to be considered. The shorter
the required measurement time and the less intrusive to the patient, the better
tolerated is the measurement process.

Abstract: Breast imaging is an integral part of breast cancer management. Many
imaging modalities are available in assisting clinicians in the screening and detection of breast cancer. These can be broadly grouped under three categories: X-raybased breast imaging, magnetic-field-based breast imaging, and ultrasound
wave-based breast imaging. Mammography is the most used X-ray-based breast
imaging. This chapter provides an overview of various imaging modalities with
emphasis on mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. Their
uses in pre- and post-treatment settings, along with their advantages and disadvantages are presented from an Indonesian perspective.

INTRODUCTION
Imaging plays a pivotal role in modern medicine. In breast cancer, imaging is
crucial either in pre- or post-definitive treatment settings. Early detection and
intervention are essential for successful management. Adequate information on
post-treated sites is equally important since the sequelae of local or distant metastasis will influence the patients’ quality of life, or mortality risk at some point.
There are three routinely utilized imaging modalities for breast cancer screening
and detection: mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). Mammography involves the use of low energy x-ray (20–30 keV) to
produce a mammogram of the breast (1–3). Suspicious masses, abnormal
­
­calcifications, or any other deformities, are presented as two-dimensional images.
Ultrasound and MRI are ‘supplementary mammography’, the enables the distinction of cysts from solid masses whereas the latter helps to determine the extent of
breast cancer after diagnosis. In some circumstances, a dynamic contrast-enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) may be introduced as a powerful tool for breast cancer detection;
however, the procedure itself is costly and requires a longer time to produce and
interpret result (4, 5). This chapter provides an overview of mammography,
­ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of breast
cancer from an Indonesia perspective.

X-RAY-BASED BREAST IMAGING (XBI)
X-ray-based conventional mammography is a routine approach worldwide for
breast screening (Figure 1). Several variations of x-ray-based imaging (XBI) technique is available, for example, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and contrastenhanced digital mammography (CESM), each with its own advantages and
disadvantages (1, 3, 6).

Pre-Treatment XBI
The current NCCN guidelines for breast cancer workup recommend diagnostic
bilateral mammograms after history and physical examination, especially if the
breast cancer is suspected to be non-invasive (e.g., ductal carcinoma in-situ or
DCIS) (7). Routine use of mammography to identify possible abnormality in
women without any breast-related signs and symptoms is a standard practice.
Also, lumps or palpable masses upon physical examination are indications for
mammography. Several abnormalities of breast tissue structure such as architectural distortion, asymmetricity of the breast area, lymphadenopathy, edematous
area, and thickening or retraction of areolar tissue can be detected during such
screening (6, 8, 9). Upon localization of a mass, the next step is to decide whether
it is necessary to continue the workup sequence with the other breast imaging
modalities or biopsy, for example, fine-needle aspiration. Microcalcifications have
the potential to be malignant, whereas macrocalcifications are likely caused by
aging or inflammatory reactions (6, 8, 10–12).

oblique view. Image was provided by Division of Oncology, Department of Surgery, Faculty
of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara.

Apart from its practical use, mammograms can give false-negative or falsepositive results (10). There is an inverse correlation between breast density and
specificity of mammography as seen among Chinese women who typically have
denser breast tissue thus increasing the likelihood of false-negative results. The
effect of breast density also influences the workup flow, as ultrasound imaging
may be required to confirm the diagnosis in the population of women with dense
breasts. Interestingly, women with higher breast tissue density are at a higher risk
of developing breast cancer or being falsely diagnosed with breast cancer (falsepositive). ‘Masking effect’ of denser breast tissue may mask or cover any smaller
malignant foci since the attenuation between cancers and fibro-glandular breast
tissue is relatively similar. Nevertheless, the findings of dense breast tissue during
diagnostic or even screening mammogram sessions should raise the possibility of
an unfavorable diagnosis (13–15).
Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), is a modified or advanced method of
mammography which creates a stacked image due to its multiple projections from
various angles, ranging from 15° (narrow range) to 60° (wide range) in relation to
the chest wall. DBT provides more accurate localization of a suspected area due to
its ability to produce 3D breast imaging in half-millimeter slices. The principal
rule of DBT is similar to mammogram but a higher radiation dose (approximately
20% higher) is used; this results in a higher cancer detection rate (CDR), by
15–20%, because of increased sensitivity and specificity. The addition of DBT to
routine digital mammography can increase the detection rate up to 27% with a
reduced false-positive rate of 15%. However, it is too costly to be implemented
routinely. A meta-analysis by Alabousi et al. confirmed that the combination of
DBT and digital mammography exhibits a higher and statistically significant CDR
of 6.36 per 1000 cases screened, compared to mammography alone with 4.68 per
1000 cases (16–19). On the other hand, contrast-enhanced digital tomography
(CEDM) helps in the identification of angiogenesis pattern because of the uptake
of the iodine-based contrast medium by the breast tissues; this may also help in
the identification of ‘occult cancer’ which linearly correlated with angiogenesis
activity. The sensitivity and specificity of CEDM vary among studies, some studies
reporting almost 100% (20, 21). A combination of CEDM and DBT may provide
even better diagnostic value, due to the combination of two remarkable diagnostic
abilities, i.e., 3D imaging and better angiogenesis identification (22).

Post-Treatment XBI
Post treatment, whether surgical or non-surgical, imaging follow-up is recommended 6 to 12 months after surgery as per the NCCN guidelines of 2020, and
routine mammograms every 12 months after breast cancer surgery are highly
­recommended except for prior reconstructed breasts (2B category). Findings of
suspicious lesion may shorten the interval between mammography sessions
(7, 10, 23–26). Certain clinical features that are expected after breast cancer surgery are skin thickening, localized edema, fluid collection, scar, fat necrosis, and
dystrophic calcifications; most of those features are acutely apparent or up to
6 months after the procedure. These features are generally implied as ‘leave-alone’
features. Skin thickening and edema are the most common findings after breast
cancer surgery because of trabecular thickening or temporary increase of breast
density related to localized edema; these gradually become normal with time.
Fluid collection post-operatively (seroma) is a normal event due to cavity
­formation as result of lumpectomy creating post-surgical, anatomically, empty
space. Post-surgical scar is a common event since the surgeon had altered the
breast structures, and the scar is as an ‘anatomical marker’ of recent surgery.
Regarding calcifications, their correlation with trauma is remarkable. Since operative procedures ‘traumatize’ the tissue, large calcifications (>5 mm) without
­suspected mass or accompanying micro-calcifications are caused by the recent
invasive procedures, with or without damaged necrotic fat tissue (27–29).
The breast-imaging reporting and databases system (BI-RADS) is routinely
used to describe the mammogram results by the radiologist specifically for the
suspected malignant foci, ranging from 0 (incomplete), 1 (negative), 2 (benign),
3 (probably benign), 4 (suspected malignancy), 5 (suggestive malignancy), and
6 (malignancy-proven). The ‘incomplete’ conclusion from BI-RADS assessment
means that some follow-up imaging, for example, ultrasonography or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), may have to be considered to confirm the locoregional
restaging for the next treatment phase, for example, radiotherapy. Findings
of residual lesions require long-term breast surveillance (28–30). The findings of
architectural distortions and neo-density do not always mean that they are of concern because tissue-scarring post-operatively may mimic recurrence. Post-breast
cancer surgery imaging should be carried out purposefully to conserve or improve
the patients’ condition (16, 31), and routine screening of the remaining breast
should be recommended as neo-density or cancerous spread may occur. If both
breasts were removed entirely, a mammogram had no place at all in the postoperative care; however, invasion of the skin or chest wall is possible, and
­therefore, the area should be examined annually (27, 32). CEDM should be considered as well if local cancer spread is suspected, as it provides a better insight
into treatment response. Iodine-based CEDM had expanded the sensitivity of
post-operative annual mammograms for up to 66.7% vs. 27.8% (21, 33, 34).
DBT may resolve overlapping breast tissue parenchyma by offering a 3D
­version of the breast post-operatively. Secondary breast surveillance by DBT
should be recommended if the results of previous mammogram findings were
suspiciously malignant, as DBT can identify neo-density focus. Accordingly, DBT
can improve the ‘confidence’ of the operator to accurately determine whether a
biopsy should be considered to confirm the suspicion. The sensitivity, specificity,
and accuracy of DBT if combined with mammograms (especially full-field digital

Breast Imaging in Pre- and Post-Definitive Treatment

mammography or FFDM) are 100.0%, 92.1%, and 95.3% respectively. To that
fact, the role of DBT in the late-phase of breast cancer management workup, particularly in the post-operative phase, is to assist the previous mammograms as it
possesses a higher sensitivity in terms of identifying suspected breast tissues’
architectural distortion (28, 35, 36).

MAGNETIC FIELD-BASED BREAST IMAGING (MFBI)
The use of MFBI in the management of breast cancer is currently optional. MFBI
is auxiliary to the current mammogram screening routines, and functions to
determine the extent of the previously diagnosed breast cancer, for example, the
detection of additional malignant foci or to estimate the size of those foci. There
are many variations to the MFBI technology, such as, simple magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and elastography (MRE)
(1, 3, 4). Annual MRI is recommended by the American Cancer Society for
patients with high risk of breast cancer, for example, patients with known BRCA1
or BRCA2 gene mutations, having a first-degree relative with gene mutation, history of radiation therapy to the chest area on the second to third decade of life, or
having certain congenital syndromes, for example, Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The
National Cancer Institute had published the breast cancer risk tool (BCRiskTool)
which consists of several guidelines to assist physicians in determining the risk
among women. Women with the lifetime risk of 20% or greater are suitable for
receiving yearly follow-up and screening. Inversely, if the risk score is less than
15%, the diagnostic workup may be restricted to the essential part of the breast
imaging management, for example, mammogram (3, 10, 27).

Pre-Treatment MFBI
The extent of the cancerous foci is remarkably important, and MRI is currently
the most sensitive tool to delineate the cancer extent although its role in diagnostic phase remain controversial (37, 38). The extent of ductal carcinoma in
situ (DCIS), particularly the non-mass-forming subtype, is notably challenging
with XBI alone or with ultrasound wave-based breast imaging (UWBI, which is
elaborated in the next section). The extent of DCIS is easily interpretable with
MRI than XBI. While DCIS is literally an ‘in situ neoplastic proliferation of
­ductal-lobular epithelial cells’, its ability to be invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)
should always be considered. A suspicious DCIS features on mammogram
should be sufficient for the physician to consider MRI or MFBI before any
­histopathological measures are taken (38–40). Special cases such as metastatic
disease or elevated liver function biomarkers, should warrant contrast-enhanced
MRI on the respective area of suspicious metastatic foci (7). Nevertheless, the
role of MFBI or MRI in determining the stage of breast cancer in women is questionable despite its superior sensitivity over mammogram. Several studies have
concluded that MRI assessment preoperatively does not impact the surgical
treatment, or even relatively harmful considering more area would be resected
because of ‘more sensitive’ identifications (false-positive identification) (41, 42).
Also, it is controversial whether better detection of a suspected foci with MFBI

87

or MRI will translate to favorable surgical outcomes (43). A meta-analysis by
Houssami et al., showed that pre-operative MRI does not significantly affect the
local or distant recurrence of breast cancer (42–44). Compared to mammography, MRI examinations are more costly, either from direct expenditure by routine application in clinical practice or indirectly through its higher false-positive
results, leading to unnecessary biopsies or avoidable further diagnostic workup.
Therefore MRI is almost strictly recommended in a specific population of highrisk women according to American Cancer Society guidelines (41, 43, 45, 46).
As mentioned earlier, the accuracy of mammography is inversely correlated to
the breast density because of higher background parenchymal enhancement or
denser fibro-glandular tissue proportion (45–47). For that reason, the ‘dense
breast’ populations may benefit from MRI.
With the advancement in MFBI technologies additional ‘auxiliary’ imaging
techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), are available. DWI is
based on Brownian movement, where the diffusion of water molecules across the
breast is used to generate contrast MRI images. Image acquisition in DWI is established by motion-sensitizing gradients to capture the water mobility in breast
­tissues, and commonly paired with dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI, or MRIalone to limit the false-positive rate and reduce unnecessary workup in advance.
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is the main limitation of DWI in clinical
practice due to its heterogeneity, which is basically defined as diffusion rates, or
water-occupied area per unit time. A meta-analysis by Jonas-Meyer mentioned
that the variability of ADC among breast cancer subtypes is insignificant (48, 49).
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is aimed at determining the differences
in biomechanical properties (stiffness, or elasticity) between normal and malignant breast tissues. The stiffness of malignant breast tissue (and its surrounding
area) is higher when compared with normal tissues. NAC response monitoring by
MRE should be considered to some extent since tumor stiffness and its mechanical properties changes may be observable approximately two weeks after NAC
initiation. Although pre-operative MRE data minimally influence the planned
treatment, guidance of NAC response is eventually beneficial to evaluate its regimen effectivity and other supportive measures can be determined earlier (50, 51).

Post-Treatment MFBI
Post-operative MFBI or MRI is not routinely implemented to evaluate outcomes
of surgical procedures due to strong enhancements of inflammatory tissues
post-operatively in the acute phase. Consequently, immediate breast MRI is not
recommended until 12 to 18 months after the procedures. The current guidelines
do not recommend MFBI in treated breast cancer, and MRI is mostly indicated
if recurrence of metastatic foci is suspected. However, breast MRI is eventually
superior to detecting developing neo-density or other suspicious structures
(7, 52, 53). In post-surgery settings, the result of MRI imaging is classified into
enhancing mass, non-mass-like enhancement (NMLE), or suspected foci––with
the characteristic of each focus fully described, for example, size, shape, margin
(smooth, irregular, or even spiculated), and internal enhancement pattern
(Figure 2). NMLE findings are elaborated according to their distributions along the
breast tissue (focal, regional, segmental, scattered, or involving multiple regions),

Breast Imaging in Pre- and Post-Definitive Treatment

Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara)

internal enhancement pattern, and symmetry. Foci that are too small to be
­optimally described (usually ≤5 mm in diameter) are defined as “indescribable”
lesions (53–55).
The rate of benign radiological features post-surgery, observed by MFBI, is
common. Benign inflammatory reactions of breast fat may result in localized
necrosis. In MRI, fat necrosis appears to be round or oval mass with high signal
intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted non-fat saturated but hypointense on fatsaturated imaging. Fat identifications are important since fat-containing lesions
are extremely rare in cancerous findings; however, in acute phase post-operative
care, enhancement around the suspected necrotic fat lesion may be apparent.
Confirmed fat necrosis lesion by MRI can place the post-operative categorization
to BI-RADS 2 or 3 as the findings are naturally benign. Unusual peripheral
enhancement of fat necrosis may raise an indication for additional workup tools
namely biopsies even though it is generally unnecessary (52, 53, 56). Localized
edema closer to the incision area may also be observed. On several occasions,
edema may be accompanied by skin thickening, and both these features interfere
with routine mammography or other XBI. For that reason, MRI imaging is highly
recommended considering fat-suppression imaging on T2-weighted sequences
(often termed T2 imaging) can differentiate edema and skin thickening with a
relative increase in breast tissue density. Similar to mammography, edema findings
are most apparent during the initial phase of post-surgery and decreased significantly after 3 years (57). Seroma and hematoma are the other commonly observed
post-surgery imaging features as the result of localized fluid collection. MRI may
detect seroma on T1-weighted imaging (low signal) and on T2-weighted imaging
(high signal) regardless of the application of the fat-suppression method.
Hematoma findings on MRI are inverse of seroma in terms of signal appearance
on T1- and T2-weighted images (27, 52).
DWI is more useful during the pre-operative phase since the main concept of
the imaging is to provide qualitative and quantitative information of random
water molecules motion as influenced by thermal agitation. Nevertheless, DWI

89

utilization in post-surgery settings may substitute the dynamic-contrast enhanced
(DCE)-MRI, and reduce the risk of gadolinium-based contrast agents along with
shorter time needed in image acquisition and results interpretation (58).
Implementing MRE post-operatively is unusual since it is mostly utilized to investigate and evaluate NAC response in the pre-operative phase and has a minimal
role in post-surgery settings (51).

Ultrasound Wave-based Breast Imaging (UWBI)
Ultrasound (US) wave-based breast imaging (UWBI) in breast cancer workup
is highly reliable, feasible, and attainable due to its rapid and low-cost aspects.
Also, US does not introduce any radiation exposure. The main role of the US is as
an assisting tool to mammogram if a certain focus is mammographically occult
to identify. Differentiating solid and liquid lesions is the main concept of ultrasonography, and the images are represented as hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or even
anechoic lesions. Recent advancements in UWBI imaging particularly on the signal processing aspect has raised several possibilities to expand the use of US in
breast cancer workup. Accordingly, 3D-modelled US imaging outcomes is possible as demonstrated after automatic breast ultrasound (ABUS). Modification or
add-on techniques such as doppler ultrasound and contrast media instigation to
evaluate local blood flow or areas of vascularization should improve the quality of
imaging workup (2, 3, 59, 60).

Pre-Treatment UWBI
UWBI contributes vitally to pre-treatment phase of breast cancer management.
Nevertheless, US is still classified as an auxiliary tool to mammogram along with
MRI, and barely considered as a confirmatory imaging technique of a suspected
cancerous lesion although US assessments may favorably differentiate solid or
liquid masses. Liquid masses are mostly benign and further follow-up can be
withheld. According to the NCCN guidelines for breast cancer management, the
status of US is ‘if necessary imaging’ (DCIS-possibility lesion are not required to
undergo US evaluation), or ‘considered’ if auxiliary assessment is demanded (7).
According to some reports, the diagnostic performance of combined imaging
approach by using mammogram + DBT + US is significantly superior to DM or
DBT alone, even comparable to MRI imaging (61, 62).
Sonographic BI-RADS findings should be correlated with the previous mammography results. Tissue composition reporting which consists of echogenicity of
breast tissue parenchyma (using fat tissue as the comparison) is parallel with the
findings on mammogram. For instance, homogenous echotexture-fibroglandular
is parallel with extremely dense tissue on mammogram. Inversely, heterogenous
echotexture of fat will be parallel to heterogenous density. Masses observed on US
should also be compared with mammogram, even though different mass descriptor index is used, for example, oval, round, or irregular on mammograph, which
is not the case with US. In US, margin description may assist in determining
malignancy (Figure 3). Angular margin (which is unique to US), micro-lobulated,
or spiculated findings may suggest non-benign diagnosis, although it is not a confirmation. Calcifications, which are neatly described in either mammogram or

Breast Imaging in Pre- and Post-Definitive Treatment

diagnosis of breast neoplasm. Image provided by Division of Oncology, Department of
Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Sumatera Utara.

MRI, are not typically screened on US. However, findings of intraductal calcification should be considered as a suspicious mass, and further confirmation on
mammogram or even core biopsy is highly indicated (63, 64).
US helps identifying axillary lymph nodes involvement. Usually, surgeons
would offer sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy before the patient undergo axillary
lymph node dissection (ALND). Some of the previously SLN-assessed patients
will require ALND as well. US imaging (especially on axillary region) with fineneedle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has demonstrated considerable diagnostic
­accuracy (65, 66).

Post-Treatment UWBI
Post-operative findings on US are similar to mammogram and MRI, although the
current recommendation of NCCN does not mention UWBI-based imaging as
essential in this stage (Figure 4) (7). Seroma, hematoma, and lymphedema are
commonly depicted as anechoic fluid collections. Solid to cystic nodules can be
observed as well, and some of these may be resorbed completely as the healing
process occur. The occurrence of lymphedema should raise an awareness for
possible delayed breast cellulitis, as seen among patients who had surgery in
upper lateral segment of the breast. Skin thickening findings are benign, and
usually appear as bright echogenic lines with hypoechoic dermis (63, 67, 68). Fat
necrosis appears as a solid hypoechoic mass mostly with posterior acoustic
shadow since it is a complex of intra-cystic or solid masses. While cystic masses
possess internal echogenic bands, which is highly influenced by the patients’

current position, solid masses have circumscribed or ill-defined margins due to
alterations of breast parenchyma area (69).

ADDITIONAL BREAST CANCER IMAGING
Several imaging modalities, for example, computed tomography (CT)-scans, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) scan, and bone scan
may be considered further if the circumstances indicate. In breast CT, image
acquisition is relatively more comfortable compared to mammography which
require remarkable compressions of the breast to acquire good-quality imaging;
however, breast CT may introduce several radiation doses, which is a concern. CT
imaging for breast cancer is a recent addition and the current NCCN guidelines
currently do not mention any use of CT in early breast cancer workup. Nevertheless,
the role of CT-scans in advanced breast cancer or recurrent breast malignancy is
recommended by the NCCN 2022 and ESMO 2021 guidelines. Presentation of
pulmonary symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath may
suggest an indication for chest diagnostic CT. The presence of other systems
such as abdominal or neurologic symptoms should be indicated for abdominalpelvic or head contrast-enhanced-CT-scan, respectively, with corresponding role
for contrast-enhanced MRI. The intervals of follow-up for metastatic patient

Breast Imaging in Pre- and Post-Definitive Treatment

monitoring are correlated with the ongoing medication administered. It is recommended to undergo CT chest/abdominal-pelvic with contrast every 4 cycles in
chemotherapy-treated or 4–6 months in endocrine-treated patients (7, 70, 71).
A retrospective study by Cho et al., stated that diagnostic chest CT can describe a
breast malignancy by its descriptor, e.g., larger in size compared to benign lesion,
irregular in shape, not circumscribed in margin, and axillary lymph node or skin
thickening presence. The study also confirmed chest-CT provided higher detection rate on denser breast tissue populations (type b–d) with the value of 36.4%
vs. 9.0% for type b, 42.1% vs. 10.5% for type c, 63.6% vs. 18.2% for type d. To
put things into context, type a breast was defined as almost entirely fatty breast,
type b and c for the presence of scattered fibroglandular density and heterogeneously dense, and type d as extremely dense breast tissue. Utilization of CT-scan
in post-operative settings entirely at the discretion of the physician (72).
FDG PET/CT in breast cancer workup is similarly placed as CT-scan in terms
of overall workup sequences according to NCCN 2022 guideline, which is
considered as a special approach if several conditions were met. This is because of
the low sensitivity of FDG PET/CT in detecting primary breast cancer, especially
for smaller size tumors (<1 mm) or non-invasive breast cancer (Table 1).
Nevertheless, its performance in defining distant metastatic foci is remarkable,
since the additional disease detection rate by FDG PET/CT is higher than most
whole-body imaging techniques. In some circumstances, the utilization of FDG

PET/CT may raise a diagnosis from locoregional breast cancer to stage IV, hence
altering the approaches which significantly affect the management. For that
reason, FDG PET/CT is extremely useful in the later stages of disease. However,
performing FDG PET/CT in the early stage of disease should be able to conclude
the patient as a locoregional case, hence providing a more-specific staging of
breast cancer (73, 74).
As per the NCCN and ESMO guidelines, bone scan may be indicated if a
specific symptom, such as bone pain, or alkaline phosphatase increase are reported
(Figure 5). The current recommendation state that the scan intervals of monitoring
are comparable to contrast enhanced CT-scan. Bone scan can be done either as CT
scans or FDG PET/CT (7, 71); however, several studies have reported that PET/CT
performed significantly better in almost all of the diagnostic parameters in
identifying metastatic bone lesions in breast cancer (71, 75–82).

CONCLUSION
Breast imaging is vital in assisting clinicians in screening, diagnosis, characterization,
staging, treatment design, monitoring treatment efficacy, and ongoing monitoring
of breast cancer patients. In this chapter, we have presented various imaging
modalities available today from an Indonesian perspective. Certain aspects may
vary from the common practices of the West or the rest of the world, at least in
part due to availability of resources and cultural backgrounds. However, as
discussed, no single breast imaging modality is fully sufficient in all areas of breast
cancer management. A combination of pre- and post-treatment imaging strategies
are required for the effective management of patients with breast cancer.

Abstract: Distant metastasis is the primary driver of breast cancer-associated mortality, and research into the mechanisms underlying hematogenous tumor cell dissemination could give rise to the development of novel and more effective therapeutic
agents and strategies. Platelets are activated directly by tumor cell interaction and
indirectly by tumor-secreted factors to trigger platelet aggregation, degranulation,
and the subsequent release of pro-tumorigenic factors. Platelet presence within the
primary tumor, bloodstream, and metastatic sites allows for continuous exposure of
breast cancer cells to these factors, making platelets a powerful partner in tumor cell
dissemination. Platelet-tumor cell crosstalk contributes to hematogenous breast
cancer metastasis by providing physical and biochemical support to metastasizing
cells via mechanisms including protection from shear forces, anoikis, and immune
attack, and enhancement of angiogenesis, migration, and pro-tumorigenic inflammation. Here, we review platelets and their many benefits to metastatic breast cancer, their role in facilitating paraneoplastic thrombosis, and current research
regarding their potential as a breast cancer therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION
One hundred and fifty years ago, Armand Trousseau first drew the insightful connection between platelets and cancer when he noted an increased incidence of
thrombosis in patients with visceral cancer (1). Ninety years later, Gabriel and
Tatiana Gasic observed that neuraminidase, a potent inducer of thrombocytopenia, reduced pulmonary metastasis in mouse models of cancer (2–4). Since then,
the contribution of platelets to the progression and dissemination of cancer has
been established across cancer types and tissues of origin. In breast cancer (BC)
specifically, where patients with advanced, distantly metastatic disease face a
5-year survival rate of only 30% (5), the ability of platelets to support tumor cell
survival and aggressiveness throughout the metastatic cascade is an important
area of research and therapeutic consideration. Furthermore, high co-incidence of
coagulopathies and cancer—acknowledged by Trousseau—poses an additional
risk to patients and may be mitigated by platelet-directed therapies (6, 7). Herein,
we review the role of platelets in promoting growth and invasion in primary breast
tumors, enhancing circulating tumor cell (CTC) survival and extravasation from
the bloodstream, enabling the seeding and growth of distant metastatic lesions,
and fostering BC-associated coagulopathy.

PLATELETS
With their tremendous abundance (1.5–3.5 × 108/mL of human blood) and
unique ability to rapidly aggregate and release hundreds of factors in response to
activation, platelets are the first responders to arrive on the scene of vascular
injury and begin the process of clot formation and healing (8). Though small
(~2 μm in diameter) and anucleate, platelets contain ribosomes, mitochondria, a
cytoskeletal network, in addition to distinct α-granules, lysosomal granules, and
dense-granules, which store biologically active factors essential to injury response
and hemostatic maintenance (9). These factors can be fully synthesized within
platelet precursor megakaryocytes, acquired by receptor-mediated endocytosis or
pinocytosis, or even synthesized within the platelets themselves using pre-mRNA
generated in megakaryocytes; this allows for flexibility and diversity in platelet
storage contents (9, 10). Release of granular contents is mediated by platelet activation and degranulation, which can be triggered by a variety of agonists (e.g.,
adhesive proteins such as Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) in the vascular wall,
soluble factors such as thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), or thromboxane
A2 (TXA2)) (8).
Unfortunately, platelets are unable to discern between vascular injury and ­cancer,
which has been described as the “wound that does not heal” (11). Cancer cells
secrete several platelet agonists, including ADP and TXA2, which induce constitutive reciprocal signaling with platelets that not only supports cancer growth and
metastasis, but also induces a hypercoagulative state throughout the body (12).
Cancer-specific signals stimulate changes in nearby platelet storage contents,
­creating “tumor-educated platelets” that may be useful as surrogate biomarkers for
identifying tumor type, location, and even mutational profile (13, 14).

Platelets and Breast Cancer Metastasis

PLATELETS AND THE PRIMARY TUMOR
Primary breast tumor cells are exposed to platelets and platelet signals, as demonstrated by robust platelet marker CD42b staining of patient BC samples at the
tumor’s leading edge (15, Figure 1A). As a result, platelets secrete factors within
the primary tumor compartment which contribute to tumor cell survival, proliferation, and aggressiveness (discussed below). Accordingly, retrospective analysis
of tumor biopsies from BC patients who subsequently received treatment and
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy revealed that patients with CD42b-rich tumors
were significantly less likely to achieve pathological complete response to
­chemotherapy (15).
Tumor growth and dissemination are dependent on the acquisition of
­intratumor vasculature to provide oxygen and nutrients to rapidly dividing cancer
cells. Angiogenesis, the process by which tumors create new or co-opt existing
endothelial vasculature, is mediated by a complex balance of numerous pro- and
anti-angiogenic factors (16). Platelets are an important source of these factors,
which they store in α-granules until agonists trigger their release. When cancer
cells secrete agonists such as ADP and thrombin, nearby platelets are activated
and release pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), angiopoietin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (17). Plateletdepleted tumors show hyperpermeable vasculature and poor tumor perfusion
due to increased angiopoeitin-2 levels and diminished pericyte recruitment to

Figure 1. Platelets aid BC cells throughout the metastatic cascade. A, Platelets help primary tumor
cells migrate and intravasate by secreting factors that promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM; (20, 23)). B, Platelets protect BC
cells from shear-induced apoptosis and encourage resistance to anoikis caused by loss of
ECM attachment (55, 58, 59). C, Platelets contribute to BC immune evasion by directly
inhibiting local immune cell activation, masking immune ligands on tumor cells, and
conferring “pseudo-expression” of immune-inactivating molecules to tumor cells
(26, 31, 34, 60–64). D, Platelets support arrest and trans-endothelial migration of BC
cells and help establish the pre-metastatic niche by recruiting granulocytes to the area
(72–75). Figure created with biorender.com.

hemorrhagic blood vessels (18). On the other hand, tumor cell-activated platelets
enhance endothelial tube formation in vitro, and increase tumor vascularization
and metastatic burden in vivo (19, 20). Patients with BC display significantly
increased levels of systemic platelet-sequestered angiogenic factors VEGF, plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β;
Figure 2) compared to healthy controls; this upregulation is correlated with higher
incidence of lymph node metastasis and advanced disease stage (21).
To disseminate, tumor cells must invade the surrounding tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) and penetrate the vasculature (Figure 1A). In one form of
metastatic progression, tumor cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), wherein single epithelial tumor cells acquire invasive mesenchymal
morphology and behavior (22). Breast tumors showing greater platelet presence
tend to show more EMT-like characteristics (e.g., loss of apical-basal polarity, loss
of E-cadherin expression, gain of vimentin expression) than those with less platelet activity (15). This is mediated largely through increased concentrations of
intratumor TGF-β, which is abundantly secreted via platelet α-granules and activates transcription of EMT-related genes across cancer types (20, 23, 24). Platelets
also engage EMT through direct interaction with cancer cell α2β1 surface integrins, which activates the Wnt-β-catenin pathway and upregulates autocrine
TGF-β production by cancer cells (25). Furthermore, platelets constitutively
express the cell surface TGF-β-docking Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant
(GARP) receptor, which is essential for the conversion of TGF-β from its latent to
active form and increases the pool of active TGF-β within the primary tumor
(Figure 2) (26).
Whether mediated by EMT or collective cell migration (CCM), in which cells
retain epithelial characteristics and invade as a group (27), remodeling of the
ECM in the primary tumor compartment is an essential step in metastasis and is
stimulated by bidirectional signaling between platelets and tumor cells (20).
Platelet-stimulated paracrine and autocrine TGF-β signaling upregulates BC cell
expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and -9) (18, 20, 25),
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (18), and various proteases (18, 20, 25),
which encourage the degradation of the ECM to enable cellular migration and
invasion. Conversely, sustained TGF-β activity enhances tumor cell production of
pro-tumorigenic ECM molecules like fibrin, fibronectin, and collagen, which
enable cellular communication and migration (20, 25, 28).
To survive and spread, BC cells must evade immune detection and destruction
(29). Many cancers avoid immunosurveillance by acquiring expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which negatively regulates CD8+ T cell function; as a result, PD-L1 checkpoint blockade treatments have become an attractive
therapeutic approach in recent years (30). Zaslavsky et al. observed that platelets
express PD-L1—particularly after activation by tumor cells—and can confer
PD-L1 “pseudo-expression” to PD-L1-/- mouse tumors, resulting in decreased
T cell-driven cytotoxicity and increased tumor burden (31). Likewise, patients
with PD-L1-negative lung cancer who responded to PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition
tended to have greater platelet infiltration in biopsied tumors, suggesting that
platelet presence sensitizes PD-L1-deficient cancers to PD-L1-directed therapies,
though these results need to be confirmed on a larger cohort of patient samples
(31). Other groups have observed that platelets also suppress cytotoxic T cell
function in the tumor microenvironment through platelet-GARP driven activation

Platelets and Breast Cancer Metastasis

of TGF-β (Figure 2B) (26), which inhibits T cell proliferation and activity through
a diverse array of mechanisms reviewed by Gorelik and Flavell (32) and Thomas
and Massagué (33). Furthermore, platelets provide well-documented protection
of tumor cells from natural killer (NK) cells (34). Though this phenomenon likely
exists within the primary tumor, it has been most thoroughly documented in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and will be described in more detail below.

source of TGF-β in blood plasma, secreting huge amounts of latent TGF-β (LTGF-β) complexes
in α-granules upon activation, which are then processed and activated by factors found on
platelets and other cell types as shown in B (24). B, Platelets constitutively express the
“Glycoprotein A Repetitions Predominant” (GARP) receptor, which docks LTGF-β (derived
from platelets or other cell types) for activation. This substantially increases the local
reservoir of active TGF-β (26). C, Direct contact between platelets and tumor cells via the
cancer cell surface integrin α2β1 stimulates the Wnt-β-Catenin signaling pathway. This
upregulates downstream transcription of tgfb1, resulting in increased TGF-β secretion by
tumor cells (25). Active TGF-β secreted by platelets and tumor cells is bound by the TGF-β
receptor on tumor cells, driving SMAD phosphorylation and downstream signaling that
increases transcription of genes related to EMT, ECM remodeling, and more. TGF-βR, TGF-β

PLATELETS AND CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS
BC cells metastasize to distant organs by directly intravasating into blood vessels
or indirectly entering into the lymphatic system which drains into the bloodstream (35). Upon hematogenous entry, an array of threats create a survival bottleneck for metastatic cells, and very few CTCs survive and successfully seed
metastases (36). To survive these dangers, CTCs rapidly recruit platelets to provide physical protection and biochemical enhancements (37). In fact, platelets are
the first cells in circulation to adhere to CTCs, forming microthrombi in seconds
which then recruit fibrin, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages for additional aid (38).
Under normal physiologic conditions, platelets are recruited to sites of injury
upon disruption of the basement membrane, which exposes subendothelial procoagulation factors (e.g., tissue factor (TF), VWF, collagen) typically unavailable
in circulation (8). CTCs co-opt platelet activity by expressing these same factors.
For example, widespread TF overexpression by cancer cells is driven by signaling
programs associated with oncogenic transformation and EMT (39, 40). As a
receptor for key components of the coagulation cascade, TF expression by cancer
cells encourages localized thrombus formation and is associated with increased
metastatic success and worse patient outcomes (41, 42). Likewise, aberrant
expression of the adhesive glycoprotein VWF has been observed in BC (43) and
other cancer types (44, 45). Tumor cell VWF secretion increases overall plasma
VWF concentrations, contributing to paraneoplastic hypercoagulopathy; furthermore, tumor cells can directly bind VWF via αvβ3 integrins (46) or glycoprotein
Ib/V/IX complexes (47), allowing them to self-aggregate, adhere to platelets, and
arrest under flow conditions (45, 46).
In addition to the indirect modes of platelet-CTC aggregation described above,
where cells need not interact directly but aggregate through mutual binding of
coagulation factors, direct platelet-CTC binding can occur through a variety of
receptor-ligand interactions. Platelet P-selectin interaction with CTC mucins
(48–50), platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) interaction with CTC galectin-3 (51),
and platelet receptor FcγRIIa interaction with CTC immunoglobulin G (IgG) (52)
have all been described (53). While these unique receptor-ligand dynamics present enticing therapeutic targets for inhibition of platelet-CTC interactions, the
sheer number of molecules which can redundantly promote CTC binding and
platelet activation may thwart these attempts.
BC cells in circulation are susceptible to anoikis, a type of programmed cell
death triggered by loss of attachment to the ECM (54). Secreted platelet proteins
promote anoikis resistance by upregulating CTC expression of the GTPase RhoA,
thereby activating the transcription co-activator YAP1 and inducing expression of
downstream genes involved in proliferation and apoptotic resistance (55). It is
also widely believed that platelets physically guard CTCs from the shear forces of
the bloodstream, which can induce cell cycle arrest (56), apoptosis, and necrosis
(57). Although limited experimental evidence exists to support platelet-mediated
shear force protection (58), in silico modeling of CTC-platelet interactions under
shear indicates that platelets may reduce the total shear force magnitude applied
to any single region of a tumor cell, decreasing deformation and damage of the
membrane and preventing apoptosis (59, Figure 1B).

Platelets and Breast Cancer Metastasis

Perhaps the most widely studied benefit conferred by platelets to tumor cells
is NK cell evasion, which is achieved by manipulating the behavior of both tumor
cells and the NK cells themselves. Kopp and colleagues observed that plateletsecreted TGF-β downregulates expression of the activating immunoreceptor
NKG2D by NK cells, diminishing their cytotoxic effects (60). Platelets also impair
NK cell production of interferon gamma (IFNγ), which is a key effector molecule
through which NK cells induce an adaptive immune response (61, 62). In addition, platelets release sheddases ADAM10 and ADAM17 which cleave NK ligands
from the surface of tumor cells and prevent them from being targeted (63).
Platelets can also confer “pseudo-expression” of the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I to tumor cells, which allows tumor cells to avoid NK targeting without triggering T-cell surveillance (64, Figure 1C).
Soon after entry into the bloodstream, CTCs travel to distant sites where they
arrest and begin to extravasate. Vascular arrest occurs through both passive means
(i.e., size-restricted arrest, where CTCs are physically trapped within small capillaries) (65) and active mechanisms (i.e., adhesion to the endothelium or subendothelial matrix) (66, 67); platelets have been implicated in both processes, though
their roles are controversial (68). While platelets have been observed in CTC clusters mechanically arrested by size-restriction, it is unclear whether platelets are
necessary for this entrapment, or if they simply pile up around CTCs that are
blocking their passage (69). Likewise, direct CTC binding to both the endothelium (70) and the subendothelial matrix (67) has been noted even in the absence
of preliminary platelet thrombus formation, suggesting that platelets are not
strictly necessary for initial arrest. However, platelets have been implicated in
tumor cell tethering, rolling, and adhesion to the endothelium via P-selectin interactions (71), suggesting that they may provide stability to CTC attachment.

PLATELETS AND DISTANT METASTASIS
Regardless of their role in vascular arrest, platelets significantly bolster the process
of extravasation. In addition to the migratory advantage platelet-induced TGF-β
signaling confers to tumor cells (23), platelets potentiate tumor cell-induced
endothelial retraction (72) and induce the loss of endothelial tight junctions (73).
These changes support trans-endothelial migration by tumor cells, which is further evidenced by observations that platelet inhibition significantly reduces tumor
cell extravasation (73, Figure 1D).
Because they are rare and transient in vivo and difficult to model in vitro, relatively little is known about the initial stages of BC metastatic colonization, and
specifically how these events are impacted by platelets. It is likely that many of
the same platelet-tumor cell signaling programs that occur during primary
tumor growth and intravasation are useful to disseminated tumor cells (e.g.,
platelet-induced tumor cell MMP secretion for ECM degradation, platelet
expression of pro-angiogenic factors, etc.), though few of these dynamics have
been demonstrated specifically during early metastatic colonization. On the
other hand, platelets have been specifically implicated as early founders of the
“pre-metastatic niche”. Labelle et al. observed that granulocytes are recruited to
the vicinity of CTC-platelet aggregates arrested in the vasculature, where they

107

108

help prepare a microenvironment amenable to tumor cell seeding (74,
Figure 1D). Granulocyte recruitment is dependent on chemokine signaling by
activated platelets, and metastatic success is significantly attenuated by depletion of either cell type. Another study found that by inhibiting platelet activation, deposition of fibronectin in metastatic sites in the lung was significantly
decreased, resulting in a less hospitable metastatic environment and fewer
lesions (75). These results support the notion that while platelets may be dispensable for initial vascular arrest, they are necessary for successful vascular
retention and metastatic outgrowth (68).

PLATELETS AND PARANEOPLASTIC COAGULOPATHY
BC cells express high levels of pro-coagulant factors like TF and phosphatidylserine on their surfaces, or secrete them in extracellular vesicles (76). BC is also
associated with increased platelet counts overall, likely stimulated by increased
cytokine-driven thrombopoiesis, creating a positive feedback loop of platelet
hyperactivation and systemic hypercoagulation (77). Consequently, patients with
BC are at significantly higher risk than healthy patients of venous and arterial
thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, particularly following chemotherapeutic treatment (7). In fact, thromboembolic complications
are one of the leading causes of death in patients undergoing chemotherapy (78).
To mitigate the thrombotic risk associated with cancer and cancer treatment, clinicians regularly prescribe prophylactic anticoagulants like heparin as a supplement
to cancer treatment regimens (79).

PLATELETS AS A THERAPEUTIC TARGET IN BREAST CANCER
Given their well-established localization to and support of BC metastases, platelets are an attractive anti-cancer target. In one approach, platelets are directly
inhibited through antagonism of platelet receptors (e.g., P-selectin, GPVI, P2Y12)
via antibodies or small molecules (80). Numerous such drugs exist and several
have been approved for the treatment of cardiovascular disease (81), though their
use in BC treatment is largely limited to pre-clinical studies. However, administration of anti-platelet agents alone or in combination with standard-of-care therapies has shown promise in metastatic prevention across studies and cancer types,
as reviewed by Xu et al. (80).
One anti-platelet drug that has been thoroughly studied in the context of
cancer is aspirin. Aspirin is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor that acts by inhibiting
synthesis of platelet prostanoids, which promote activation of other nearby
platelets. Aspirin treatment prevents BC cell-induced platelet activation and
subsequent release of pro-tumorigenic factors in vitro (82), and leads to reduced
metastasis in an in vivo mouse model of metastatic BC by suppressing plateletenhanced anoikis resistance (83). In the clinic, observational studies of BC
patients prescribed aspirin after cancer diagnosis show mixed effects on patient

Platelets and Breast Cancer Metastasis

outcomes, though meta-analyses indicate that aspirin use is associated with
reduced risk of BC death (84). Strikingly, in randomized controlled trials of
aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, allocation to the aspirin
group reduced the incidence of distantly metastatic adenocarcinoma by nearly
half during trial follow-ups (85). This translated to significantly higher patient
survival, regardless of whether the trials tested high or low-dose aspirin. These
results suggest that low-dose aspirin may be useful in the prevention of distant
metastasis, though therapeutic success may depend on preventative rather than
responsive administration.
In another therapeutic approach, platelet localization to the tumor is exploited
to allow enhanced delivery of therapeutic molecules into the intratumoral space.
Bahmani et al. found that by encapsulating the toll-like receptor agonist resiquimod in platelet membrane-coated nanoparticles (PNPs), they enhanced uptake
and retention of the drug in the tumors of a 4T1 mouse BC model, increasing
intratumor immunity and decreasing tumor growth better than the drug alone
(86). PNPs have also been used in vitro to effectively deliver chemotherapeutic
agents, siRNAs, and photosensitizers to primary tumors and CTCs (87). Though
PNPs are not currently being used in the clinic, they present a promising new
method to increase the efficacy of existing therapeutics.

CONCLUSION
Platelets are essential partners to BC cells throughout the course of hematogenous
metastasis. Through a multitude of reciprocal signaling events, tumor cells activate platelets, encouraging their aggregation and degranulation. In return, platelets secrete factors which enhance tumor cell survival and aggressiveness. This
crosstalk threatens patients not only by its ability to foster metastatic disease, but
also in its induction of a systemwide hypercoagulative state. Therapies which target the platelet-tumor cell interaction have the potential to mitigate the danger of
BC metastasis, while also preventing cancer-associated thromboembolism.
Therapeutic options for the prevention and treatment of distantly metastatic BC
will be increased as researchers work to better understand and target the unique
mechanisms of cancer-platelet cooperation.

Abstract: Galectins play a role in mammary morphogenesis and are expressed in
all breast cancer subtypes. Galectins bind with glycoconjugates, as well as carbohydrate-independent targets in both the cytosolic and nuclear subcellular
­fractions. All tissues express galectins and galectins bind to numerous targets
localized in different subcellular domains, including cell membrane, nucleus,
mitochondria, and extracellular matrix. Galectin-3 and galectin-1 are associated
with breast cancer progression and metastasis and will be the focus of this chapter.
The chapter highlights mechanisms involved in galectins’ role in modulating metastatic breast cancer phenotype. Immunocytochemistry analysis of galectin-3 in
human breast cancer cells is used to illustrate galectin expression in the metastatic
phenotype.

INTRODUCTION
In 2020, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases developed worldwide with
breast cancer accounting for 11.7% of all cancers (1). Metastatic cancer is the
primary cause of cancer mortality. Therefore, metastatic breast cancer has attracted
a significant amount of interest from the scientific and medical communities (2).
Mammography is used for the early detection of breast cancer because it can visualize the greatest number and density of breast epithelial cells, fibroblasts and
connective tissue (3). The progression of normal tissue to malignancy can be
described in terms of initiation, promotion and progression. The MoolgavkarVenzon-Knudson model describes two-stage clonal expansion of carcinogenesis
that can be used to evaluate mammographs and quantify malignancy of breast
epithelium (4). Briefly, the first stage consists of an epithelial cell obtaining an
initial mutation to become an intermediate or precancerous cell that has the
potential to gain further mutations to become a malignant cell (4). The second
stage involves proliferation, clonal expansion and ultimately malignant transformation (4). This mathematical model considers changes in the microenvironment
in the breast during menarche, parity, and menopause, which allows it to be predictive of the etiology of breast cancer. It is hypothesized that a combination of all
the identified (and as yet unidentified) factors such as epithelial cell number, collagen density, growth factors associated with fibroblast, and extracellular matrix
proteins play a role in cancer cell survival and progression (4). Various components may interact in mammographic dense areas of the breast to increase the
number of fibroblasts that promote paracrine-dependent epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (5).
Although the exact mechanism mediating mammographic density promotion of
EMT is not completely understood, the relationship between PTEN and Mgat5 in
tumor cell survival is one possible explanation for breast cancer progression (6).
PTEN is a lipid and protein phosphatase that deactivates PI3K/Akt signaling, while
Mgat5 is a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of branched N-glycans on
glycoproteins and increases cell adhesion-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling, cell
spreading, and cell proliferation. Studies have shown that a single mutation in one
of the alleles in the PTEN gene can increase Mgat5-dependent survival of mouse
embryonic fibroblasts, which display the same morphology as migrating carcinoma
cells (6). This mechanism could possibly facilitate the accumulation of mutations by
activation of survival pathways and consequently increasing the risk of cancer cell
progression (7). In one study, 43 patients with breast cancer were compared with 10
healthy individuals. Results showed that 44.2% of breast cancer patients had PTEN
mutations associate with loss of function (8). Furthermore, these mutations encoded
for a truncated form of PTEN that was associated with metastatic phenotypic
behavior (8). Additional studies observed that patients with germline mutations in
PTEN displayed an increased risk of breast cancer (9). PTEN promoter methylation
has also been shown to influence the progression of breast cancer through the
downregulation of PTEN and corresponding increase in Mgat5-mediated activation
of PI3K/Akt signaling (9). Mgat5 expression in mammary epithelial tumor cells has
been shown to be a rate limiting factor in EMT by increasing branched N-glycans on
cytokine receptors, resulting in receptor binding to galectins and promoting
galectin-dependent extracellular matrix remodeling (9).

Galectins in Breast Cancer

Galectins are soluble lectins that bind to β-galactoside residues on glycoconjugates. TGF-β signaling regulates the expression of the TGF-β receptor and other
cytokine receptors and promotes the addition of branched N-glycans on receptors.
The downstream signaling of these cytokine receptors has been shown to regulate
the transcription of Mgat5 to maintain a EMT phenotype. Regulation of receptor
endocytosis is dependent on galectin-3 binding and oligomerizing with branched
N-glycans on glycoproteins on the cell membrane and in the extracellular matrix
(10). Branched N-glycans mediate cell migration and matrix remodeling (11). Taken
together, these data suggest that the glycobiology of mammary tissue may facilitate
mutated cell survival and further accumulation of mutations.

GLYCOBIOLOGY
Alterations in glycosylation of extracellular proteins have been characterized in
metastatic breast cancer. These structures form the glycocalyx that is composed of
membrane proteins, extracellular proteins, and lipids bound together by complex
carbohydrates (12). Glycans consist of complex carbohydrates of varying lengths,
composition, and branching. Glycans are covalently linked to glycoproteins,
glycolipids or proteoglycans, and cover the surface of all mammalian cells and
extracellular matrix components (12). N-glycans are attached to the amide nitrogen
(N-linked glycosylation) on asparagine moieties in proteins that result in an increase
in the branching, sialylation, and fucosylation during metastasis (13). Galectins
bind the N-acetyllactosamine residues on branched N-glycans that are covalently
attached to glycoproteins (integrins, growth factors, fibronectin, etc.). These
multivalent glycoproteins vary in the number of N-glycans per protein and can
induce the oligomerization of some galectins (14). This is of particular interest
because galectin binding to Mgat5 promotes mammary tumor cell proliferation,
migration, fibronectin matrix remodeling and metastasis (11, 15, 16). While Mgat5
is highly expressed in cancer, it is not the only glycosyltransferase that plays a role
in malignancy. Glycosyltransferases, located in the Golgi, participate in posttranslational modification of glycoproteins. The N-glycan profile on SKBR-3 breast
cancer cells blocks the binding of the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, as well as
displayed decreased sensitivity to doxorubicin (17). Following treatment with
tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, SKBR-3 cells displayed an
increase sensitivity to doxorubicin and corresponding decreased sensitivity to
mitogenic growth factors (17). Therefore, the glycocalyx appears to structurally
inhibit the action of anticancer treatments. Upregulation of the glycocalyx enhances
cancer cell adhesion, growth, and survival signaling (18). Specifically, chondroitinase
ABC digestion of the glycocalyx chondroitin sulfate, leads to a decrease in MCF-7
breast cancer cellular adhesion, suggesting that glycocalyx regulates integrin ligation
and activation by recruiting integrins to adhesion sites (18). This is possible because
integrins contain an active binding site for chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (19).
Galectins are localized in the glycocalyx where they interact with mucins to form a
transcellular barrier for epithelial cells that is dependent on glycan binding and
galectin oligomerization (20, 21). Galectins have been shown to interact with
chondroitin sulfate (-A, -B, and -C), as well as other components of the glycocalyx
to play a role in modulating mobility of tumor cells (22, 23).

CELLULAR ADHESIONS
Adhesions form cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix connections through a
group of glycoproteins called cell adhesion molecules. Cell adhesion molecules
are made up of two subgroups classified as calcium-independent and calciumdependent adhesion molecules (24). Calcium-independent adhesion molecules
include the immunoglobulin superfamily and the lymphocyte homing receptors,
whereas calcium-dependent adhesion molecules include integrins, cadherins, and
selectins (24). Integrins are transmembrane receptors that form a bridge between
the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. This bridge functions to relay
mechanical and chemical signals from the outside to inside of the cell. Integrins
are heterodimeric molecules composed of an α and β subunit that are noncovalently
bonded. Presently, eighteen α subunits and eight β subunits have been found in
humans that have the capacity to form twenty-four different integrins with
different ligand binding specificities (25). The direct binding of the cytoplasmic
domains of α and β subunits are responsible for sustained inactivation of integrins.
Integrin receptor activation occurs through both inside-out and outside-in
signaling (25). From inside the cell, the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit can
be phosphorylated by downstream signaling of G-protein coupled receptors to
inhibit the binding of α and β subunits that causes the activation of the integrin.
From outside the cell, extracellular ligand binding induces conformational
changes that render the cytoplasmic domain of integrins available to interact with
plaque proteins. Plaque proteins include focal adhesion kinase, talin, vinculin,
tensin, paxillin, integrin linked kinase, α-actinin and others. Activated integrins
and intracellular plaque proteins form a complex protein network of about
90 proteins on the plasma membrane known as focal adhesions (25). Focal
adhesions are present in all adherent cells, but differ in size, morphology, and
signaling. Focal adhesions are stimulated by RhoA signaling and are formed at the
end of stress fibers. The most common integrins found in focal adhesions are the
α5β1 fibronectin and αVβ3 vitronectin receptors. Both receptors play a vital role
in matrix remodeling and cell migration (26). Although, integrin receptors lack
enzymatic activity, many plaque proteins are kinases and phosphatases that play a
role in signal transduction. This signaling complex activates survival, proliferation,
and motility pathways that protect cells from death that may result from the loss
of adhesion or anoikis (26). After integrin activation, the autophosphorylation of
focal adhesion kinase creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src family
tyrosine kinases. This leads to additional tyrosine phosphorylation of focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) and recruitment of the adaptor protein GRB2/SOS that
leads to the activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and myosin light chain kinase (26).
Activated FAK also leads to the activation of PI3K/Akt survival signaling and
NF-κB-mediated increase in caspase inhibitors (27). Activation of the β1 integrin
subunit can also increase the level of phosphorylated Akt by sequestering protein
phosphatase 2A and preventing its ability to inactivate Akt (28).
Cell-extracellular matrix contacts are called fibrillar adhesions and display an
elongated morphology compared to square focal adhesions. Prior to developing
into mature adhesions, nascent adhesions display a dotlike morphology (29–31).
Mature fibrillar adhesions are composed of α5β1 integrins ligated to fibronectin
(Figure 1). The α5β1 integrins cluster in fibrillar adhesions after fibronectin

changes during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and galectin inhibition (nucleus is
dark blue, cell membrane is light blue, fibronectin is red, and galectin is yellow). In the
absence of galectin inhibition, fibronectin fibrillogenesis and actin polymerization occur and
promote EMT. In contrast, galectin inhibition result is the blockade of EMT. B) In the absence
of branched N-glycans there is reduced integrin and receptor tyrosine kinase receptor
binding to fibronectin and absence of galectin binding. C) In the presence of branched
N-glycans, there is increased binding of galectins to receptor tyrosine kinases, integrins and
fibronectin, and ultimately promotes fibrillogenesis, EMT and metastatic phenotypic
behavior. When branched N-glycans are present, the galectin lattice clusters membrane
receptors, preventing endocytosis, and stabilizes adhesions during matrix remodeling, actin
remodeling, receptor signaling, invasion, and metastasis.

ligation and the β1 cytoplasmic tail organizes tensin near actin filaments. This
fibronectin-α5β1-tensin-actin complex functions to form fibronectin fibrils (fibrillogenesis) translocating towards the center of the cell, stretching fibronectin and
to allow for polymerization. It is thought that tensile forces produced by the intracellular cytoskeleton provides the force needed for fibrillogenesis. Tensin inhibition has been shown to block α5β1 integrin translocation and fibronectin
fibrillogenesis without affecting focal adhesions (32). Focal and fibrillar adhesions
are required for tumor cell growth, migration, and matrix assembly. In the context
of tissues, most adhesions resemble fibrillar adhesions are further elongated to
form three-dimensional matrix adhesions that are composed of both focal and
fibrillar adhesion components. These complex adhesion sites are associated with
increased proliferation and faster migration compared to cells on polystyrene culture surfaces (33). Integrin-dependent migration works in a concerted manner
with cadherin cell-cell contacts to coordinate collective cell migration in metastatic breast cancer (33). Cadherins are homotypic adhesion molecules that connect cells together in the presence of calcium to form adherens junctions.
Intracellularly, cadherins have a catenin-binding domain that connects extracellular homotypic cadherin complexes with the actin cytoskeleton (33). Cadherins
were initially named for the location they were found, such as E-cadherin were

119

found in epithelial tissue, whereas N-cadherin were found in neural tissue and not
found in normal breast tissue. However, the transition from E-cadherin to
N-cadherin represents an important cellular marker of EMT in metastatic breast
cancer (34). Furthermore, N-cadherin has been shown to promote migration and
invasion, regardless of the level of E-cadherin expression in various breast cancer
cell lines (34).
Studies have also shown that extracellular galectin-3 binds Mgat5-modified
N-glycans on N-cadherin and GM1 ganglioside, a glycolipid on mammary
carcinoma cell-cell junctions, to increase the mobility of these glycoconjugates
within the membrane and resulting in the destabilization of cell-cell junctions and
the promotion of cancer cell migration (35). Other studies showed that combined
treatment with swainsonine (Mgat5 inhibitor) and β-lactose (galectin competitive
inhibitor) resulted in the significant inhibition of galectin-3 binding to branched
N-glycans on integrins, focal adhesion kinase and PI3K activation, translocation
of β1 integrins to fibrillar adhesion sites, cell migration on fibronectin substrates,
fibronectin matrix remodeling, and f-actin turnover (35). In addition, treatment
with monoclonal antibodies for the galectin-3 N-terminal domain, but not the
carbohydrate recognition domain, had no effect (35). These data suggest that the
oligomerization of extracellular galectins function as a transient framework that
has the plasticity required to support the organization of protein complexes
associated with matrix remodeling and cell migration.
Taken together, the data suggest that galectins may decrease the force of focal
adhesions enough to allow β1 integrins to translocation to form fibrillar adhesions.
This suggestion is further supported by the finding that galectin-3 decreases tumor
cell adhesion to fibronectin, collagen, and laminin, but increases fibrillogenesis
(11, 36). Therefore, extracellular galectin-3 may decrease the force needed for cells
to migrate through microscopic structures (basement membrane) to subsequently
promote invasion. Fibronectin matrix remodeling is thought to organize sites for
collagens to initiate collagen fibrillogenesis, which is dependent on fibronectin and
integrin activation (37). Collagen density plays an important role in triggering
breast cancer initiation, progression, and invasion, as well as to inducing resistance
to apoptosis caused by loss of cell anchorage (anoikis) in mammary tumor cells
(38, 39). It is now firmly established that cellular adhesions play an essential role
in survival, growth signaling, cell migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and EMT in
metastatic breast cancer (40).

GROWTH FACTORS
Growth factor activation and signaling of receptor tyrosine-kinases are initiated
following ligand binding, receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation in
various pathways including JAK/STAT, PI3K/Akt, and Ras/Raf/MAPK. Normally,
these receptor tyrosine kinases play an important role in cell proliferation and
differentiation, whereas excessive activation or dysregulation of these receptors
is associated with the promotion and progression of a variety of cancers (41).
Therefore, targeting growth factor receptors is of great interest in the treatment
of cancer. Various approaches have been developed to either block ligand binding
and dimerization or inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity in these receptors.

Galectins in Breast Cancer

The first treatment to be approved was the humanized monoclonal antibody
called trastuzumab (Herceptin), which binds to the extracellular domain of
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and blocks ligand binding
and activation (41). Specifically, trastuzumab blocks HER2 homo- and heterodimerization with other EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4 receptors (41).
While initially these treatments appear somewhat promising, various forms of
cancer have been found to circumvent these therapies. However, recent
advancements in glycomics have led to a greater understanding of the function
of glycoconjugates and their role in promoting cancer cell survival and
progression. For example, the glycans on HER2 receptors and mucins (mucins
bind all four human epidermal growth factor receptors) are thought to block the
binding of trastuzumab, and removal of these glycans significantly increases
trastuzumab binding (41). Since glycan removal also results in an increased in
sensitivity to doxorubicin in several human breast cancer cell lines (17), it is
possible that galectin-bound glycoconjugates (growth receptors and mucins)
form a barrier that blocks anticancer treatments in the same way that galectins
form a barrier on the apical membrane of epithelial cells to block the activity of
microorganisms, drugs, and vaccines (21). HER2 has been shown to induce
breast cancer cell migration, matrix remodeling, and actin reorganization by
stimulating galectin-3/phospho-caveolin-1-dependent activation of β1
integrins (21). These processes are known to be dependent on Src and ROCK/
RhoA intracellular signaling and illustrates the crosstalk that occurs between
growth factor and integrin receptors (42).

GALECTINS
During mammary morphogenesis, galectin-1 plays a role in epithelial migration
and branching structure formation, whereas galectin-3 is upregulated in epithelial
cells during involution and is associated with anti-apoptotic properties of these
cells (43, 44). Lectin binding to complex carbohydrates in the glycocalyx and
extracellular matrix has been characterized as a topological cellular storage and
transfer network with bites of information expressed in the complexity of the
carbohydrate (e.g., branched N-glycans) (45). Galectins are the most expressed
lectin in the human body and have been implicated in almost all forms of
­cancer (46). Galectins were first identified as soluble S-type lectins. Three types of
galectins have been found in humans and are classified as chimera-type, prototype, and tandem repeat-type galectins. Chimera-type galectin-3 is the only galectin of this type to be identified and contains a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition
domain and an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain responsible for the
oligomerization of galectin-3 (47). Proto-type galectins have one carbohydrate
recognition domain and can dimerize. Proto-type galectins consists of galectin-1,
galectin-2, galectin-5, galectin-7, galectin-10, galectin-11, galectin-13, g­ alectin-14,
and galectin-15 (47). Tandem repeat-type galectins have two carbohydrate recognition domains connected by a linker peptide and consists of galectin-4, ­galectin-6,
galectin-8, galectin-9, and galectin-12. Galectins differ from each other in how
they recognize carbohydrate residues. It is thought that some tandem repeat-type
galectins may recognize different carbohydrates in both carbohydrate recognition

domains. Galectins bind the N-acetyllactosamine residues on carbohydrates.
Therefore, galectin binding and oligomerization is dependent on the number of
N-acetyllactosamine residues on glycans and the extent of glycosylation on glycoproteins (15). Galectins bind with relatively weak affinities when binding to a
single saccharide. However, the oligomerization of galectins and the multivalency
of glycoproteins interact to form a lattice structure with high avidity (14, 46).
Galectins have been shown to form lattice structures as determined by liquidliquid phase separation. Under these conditions, soluble galectins are in a state of
equilibrium between monomeric form and oligomer form that can self-associate
depending on the carbohydrates present (48–50). The lattice structure of galectins helps to organize protein complexes and alters the function of glycoconjugates that the galectin lattice is a part of. The galectin lattice can prolong the
activation of cytokine receptors in breast cancer cells by decreasing constitutive
endocytosis of these receptors that acts to promote tumor cell motility, EMT and
metastasis (10).
Galectin-1 and galectin-3 are the most studied and understood galectins and
both have been implicated in the modulation of the molecular mechanisms
mediating metastatic breast cancer (10). Galectin-1 and galectin-3 have been
shown to bind glycans on GM1 gangliosides that organize raft domains on the
plasma membrane (35, 51). Galectin-1 and galectin-3 have also been shown to
bind glycans on β1 integrin and regulates fibronectin remodeling, cell migration,
and drug resistance in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (42, 52). In addition,
galectin-1 and galectin-3 have been associated with the clustering and signaling
of H-Ras and K-Ras in mammary tumor cells, respectively (53, 54). These
intracellular and extracellular functions of galectins support the migration and
survival of metastatic breast cancer cells. Galectin-3 serum levels have been
shown to be significantly elevated in patients with breast cancer as compared to
noncancerous individuals, suggesting a role for galectin-3 in intravasation and
extravasation of cancer cells (55). Studies have shown that treatment with
recombinant galectin-3 bind to the Thomsen-Friedenreich disaccharide on
MUC1, which subsequently exposes adhesion receptors that can then interact
with the endothelium (55). It appears that MUC1 can have both adhesive and
anti-adhesive properties depending on the sialylation profile of MUC1. Galectins
only bind to unsialylated glycans (56). Therefore, sialylated MUC1 will not be
organized by the galectin-3 lattice and ultimately, cell adhesion sites will be
blocked (56).
Along with cell-substrate and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, galectins
play a role in cell-cell junctions during collective migration by regulating
N-cadherin (35). Collective cell migration has been characterized in breast cancer
as a multiple cell migration led by fibroblasts or macrophages in the tumor microenvironment along paths of extracellular matrix proteins (57). Fibroblasts and
macrophages both express galectins, which function to mediate cellular activation
and motility in hypoxic areas of inflammation (58–60). Galectin-3 and galectin-1
are up regulated during hypoxic conditions and act to promote EMT, collective
migration, and ultimately breast cancer metastasis (61–63). The tumor environment that facilitates the activation of metastasis has been described as “a wound
that never heals” and is consistent with the promotional role of galectins in wound
healing and associated collagen organization (64–66). Current literature has
shown that breast polyploid giant cancer cells or syncytial (multinucleated) cells,

Galectins in Breast Cancer

are associated with increases in EMT, N-cadherin, invasion, and metastasis in
patient tumor biopsies, as well as MCF-7 cells, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells (67). Additional studies showed that hypoxia increased the fusion of nonmetastatic breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D) and multipotent stem/stromal
cells, but this was not found to occur in highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells (67). These finding suggest that hypoxia induces fusion of non-­
metastatic cells, but not necessarily in MDA-MB-231 cells because they already
display cell fusion and metastatic phenotype (68). Breast polyploid giant cancer
cells have also been shown to have higher mitochondrial content and increased
production of reactive oxygen species that can be selectively targeted with antioxidants (69). Galectins are also upregulated during hypoxia and elevated galectin
levels are a characteristic of metastatic breast cancer. In addition, galectin-1 has
been implicated in cell fusion and syncytium formation in trophoblast tumor
cells, whereas galectin-3 has been shown to mediate human trophoblast migration
and invasion (70, 71). In summary, these findings suggest a direct role for the
galectin lattice in the promotion of the dense microenvironment, receptor expression and activation, matrix remodeling, and actin cytoskeleton organization that
supports migration and is associated with fusion of human breast cancer cells
during progression and metastasis.

POSSIBLE TARGETS IN THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC
BREAST CANCER
There are currently no clinically approved galectin inhibitors for the treatment of
breast cancer. However, there are several galectin inhibitors that have produced
promising preclinical results. One promising compound appears to be a peptide
with galectin-3 specificity called G3-C12. This compound has been shown to
decrease lung metastasis of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells after injection
into athymic nude mice (72). Another promising study utilized a high-affinity
antibody that disrupts mucin-galectin interactions, resulting in the suppression of
metastasis in mucin expressing breast cancer cells (73). There are many other
potential galectin inhibitors being developed, but most are peptide and/or sugar
moieties that are designed to disrupt the carbohydrate recognition domain of
galectins. An exception to this approach is a salicylic acid derivative called
salirasib. Salirasib inhibits the activation of farnesylated Ras by binding to the
hydrophobic (farnesyl) binding pocket of galectin-1 and galectin-3, thereby
disrupting galectin-dependent clustering of various isoforms of Ras on the inner
leaflet of the plasma membrane of cancer cells, suggesting that galectin inhibition
in metastatic breast cancer can be achieved through both hydrophobic binding
and hydrophilic binding (74–76).
Given that salirasib and γ-tocotrienol have similar chemical structure and
lipophilicity, studies were conducted to determine the role of galectin-3 in
mediating the anticancer effects of γ-tocotrienol in metastatic breast cancer
cells. Previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer effects of
γ-tocotrienol (77). γ-tocotrienol is a rare natural isoform of vitamin E that displays potent apoptotic and anti-metastatic activity against a wide range of breast

123

124

cancer cells. Specifically, γ-tocotrienol inhibits breast cancer cell EMT, lipid raft
integrity, migration, invasion, and Hedgehog/Wnt/RTK signaling at treatment
doses that have little or no effect on normal mammary epithelial cell growth or
viability (77). MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells have been shown to
undergo cell fusion to produce polyploid giant cancer cells that display metastatic properties (67, 68). Polyploid giant cancer cells display increased mitochondrial content and elevations in reactive oxygen species, and these
characteristics are blocked by treatment with antioxidants (69). Results in
Figures 2 and 3 show that elevations in galectin-3 is associated with the formation of multinucleated MDA-MB-231 cells and this effect is blocked following
treatment with γ-tocotrienol. It appears that γ-tocotrienol treatment induced a
decrease in f-actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, as identified by vinculin and
f-actin positive staining (Figures 2 and 3). Since galectins levels show a positive
correlation with metastatic behavior and γ-tocotrienol significantly reduces
galectin-3 levels, these finding provide strong evidence that γ-tocotrienol
may provide significant benefit in the prevention and treatment of metastatic
breast cancer.

Figure 2. Changes in MDA-MB-231 morphology following a four-day treatment with various
anti-metastatic agents. Vinculin (green), f-Actin (red), DAPI (blue). Control 1 and Control 2
show MDA-MB-231 cells can produce giant cells with f-actin stress fibers attached to focal
adhesions and appears to be polypoidal, whereas treatment with swainsonine (golgi
inhibitor) or β-lactose (a competitive inhibitor for galectin-carbohydrate binding) eliminated
the appearance of giant cells. Cells in the 200mM Control Sucrose group (a treatment that
stimulates giant and polypoidal cell expression) also shows a polyploid giant cancer cell
migrating above the other MDA-MB-231 cells. This giant cell also contains f-actin stress fibers
attached to focal adhesions and an increase in mitochondrial content (MC) that is believed
to be due to increased oxidative metabolism, and treatment with 5µM γ-tocotrienol
completely blocked these characteristics in MDA-MB-231 cells.

Figure 3. Changes in MDA-MB-231 galectin-3 expression following a four-day treatment with
anti-galectin agents. Galectin-3 (green), DAPI (blue). Control 1, Control 2 and 200mM Control
Sucrose groups all contain galectin-3 expressing cells with different nuclear sizes (DAPI
staining) and a polyploid giant cancer cell with increased galectin-3 expression compared to
other cells in the image. Treatment with 5µM Swainsonine, 200mM β-lactose, or 5µM
γ-tocotrienol induced a large decrease in galectin-3 expression.

CONCLUSION
Extracellular galectins form a framework for protein networks to localize in
specific cellular domains. Galectins have been shown to be associated with almost
all aspects of breast cancer metastasis such as migration, matrix remodeling,
action turnover, drug resistance, angiogenesis, invasion, intravasation, and
extravasation. Cancer cells can fuse with other cancer cells and/or other cells,
such as macrophages to produce polyploid giant cancer cells, which can result in
these polyploidal cells obtaining properties from each cell and is coordinated in
one giant cell. These cells are associated with breast cancer metastasis. Galectin
expression is increased as polyploid giant cancer cells are generated. Results also
showed that metastatic breast cancer cells exposed to γ-tocotrienol were found to
display a large decrease in galectin-3 expression and a large inhibition in the
development of giant polyploid breast cancer cells. The exact molecular
mechanism by which γ-tocotrienol inhibits galectin-3 expression needs future
investigation. However, these findings strongly suggest that targeting galectins
may provide significant benefit in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Abstract: Mammary tumors display high molecular heterogeneity with regards to
their transcriptomes and proteomes. The regulation of several posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination and ISGylation, directly influences the proteome of
breast cancer cells. In particular, ISGylation is emerging as a critical factor in different
cancer types and is particularly relevant in breast cancer. This modification involves
the covalent binding of interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) to its target proteins.

Interestingly, ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18), also called UBP43, reverses
ISGylation. In addition to its activity as a de-ISGylation enzyme, USP18 is also a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling. Several studies indicate a central role of USP18
in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. This chapter discusses recent insights gained in
the molecular mechanisms of USP18 in breast cancer, and its potential implications
for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is a malignant mammary neoplasm that poses a serious health issue
worldwide. The heterogeneity of breast cancer makes it difficult to develop novel
strategies for the prevention, detection, and control of its progression. Most breast
cancer cases are sporadic. Histologically, more than 80% of the cases develop in the
mammary ducts with invasive potential and are known as invasive ductal carcinomas. At the molecular level, nearly 70% of breast cancer cases express estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα) and are referred to as breast cancer ERα+ cases. The remaining
30% of cases do not express ERα, and are referred to as breast cancer ERα- cases
(1, 2). The 13th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference recommends a
classification that includes luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpressing, and triplenegative subtypes (3). The main difference is that ERα is only detected in luminal A
and B cancer types, but luminal A types are also characterized by PR ≥20% and Ki67
<20%; whereas luminal B-like types are characterized by PR <20% and/or HER2+
and/or Ki67 ≥20%. The type characterized by an overexpression of HER2 comprises
nearly 15-20% of all cases of breast cancer. The last type is triple-negative, with a
lack of ERα, PR, and HER2 expression, and is highly aggressive (3, 4).
These subgroups warrant different therapeutic strategies. For example, HER2overexpressing breast cancer warrants therapies targeting HER2, a transmembrane
receptor with tyrosine kinase activity that lacks a ligand-binding domain but can generate homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Therapies for HER2-overexpressing breast cancer therefore
include antibodies (i.e., trastuzumab), inhibitors of the kinase activity of HER2 (i.e.,
lapatinib), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), which are cytotoxins covalently
associated with monoclonal antibodies against HER2 (5). For luminal breast cancer,
the commonly used therapy is endocrine therapy involving selective estrogen receptor
downregulators (SERDs), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (6, 7). SERDs and SERMs target ERα, which is a transcription
factor activated by 17 beta-estradiol that promotes the expression of pro-tumor genes
in breast cancer. Because of either de novo or acquired resistance to these endocrine
therapies (8), the generation of new target molecules for treatment is required. Several
alterations associated with posttranslational modifications have been reported in the
proteome of breast cancer cells. In particular, alterations in ISGylation and ubiquitination of proteins have been associated with this pathology. Interestingly, the reversion
of these modifications can be modulated by ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18), a
de-ISGylase and deubiquitinase that is also deregulated in breast cancer. In this chapter, we discuss the relevance of USP18 and its functions in breast cancer.

USP18 in Breast Cancer

GENERALITIES OF UBIQUITIN SPECIFIC
PEPTIDASE 18 (USP18)
Many cellular processes are modulated by different post-translational m
­ odifications.
One of these modifications is ubiquitination, which involves the covalent binding
of ubiquitin to target proteins. This process can be reversed by deubiquitinase
enzymes, which are central to its regulation. Moreover, ubiquitin-like p
­ roteins
also participate in post-translational modifications via mechanisms similar to
ubiquitination (9, 10). Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), also known as
ISG43, UBP43, and PTORCH2, is a member of the USP family that deubiquitinates proteins. Furthermore, USP18 enzyme is the only protease that has been
reported to reverse ISGylation, and this ability is known as de-ISGylation (11–13).
Additionally, USP18 has a negative effect on type I interferon signaling pathway
(14, 15). Thus, USP18 is an ISG15 isopeptidase and a negative regulator of interferon signaling (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Molecular actions of ubiquitin-specific protease 18 (USP18) protein. Type I interferons
(IFN-I) bind to its receptor formed by the heterodimer IFNAR1/IFNAR2 which is associated
with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosin kinase 2 (TYK2), triggering this signaling pathway.
Genes that encode enzymes involved in ISGylation, interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)
and USP18, are induced by IFN-I. USP18 associates with subunit 2 of IFN receptor (IFNRA2),
inhibiting the binding of Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1). Consequently, USP18 inhibits the
phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2.

USP18: from gene to protein and biology
The Usp18 gene is located on mouse chromosome 6, whereas the human USP18
gene is located on chromosome 22. This gene consists of 11 exons that encode
a 43-kDa protein homologous to ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs). It has
been reported that the expression of Usp18/USP18 gene is increased by several
inducers, such as type I and II interferons (IFNs) (12, 15–17), poly I:C (18),
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (18, 19), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα (19),
and bacterial and viral infections (17, 20, 21). Interestingly, the promoter of this
gene contains IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs), which mediate the
induction of USP18 expression in response to IFNs (14, 15). High expression
of Usp18 has been found in the liver, spleen, and thymus, and is remarkably
expressed in various lymphatic and hematopoietic cell populations, such as
macrophages and T and B cells (22).
USP18 protein is characterized by two functional domains: the isopeptidase
activity domain and the IFNAR2-binding domain. The isopeptidase domain of
this protease is composed of three catalytic domains, the palm, the thumb, and
the finger; and the catalytic core consists of three amino acid residues (cysteine,
aspartate, and histidine) localized between the thumb and palm domains (23).
Thus, the catalytic activity of USP18 is due to its structure that contains cysteine
and histidine boxes crucial for de-ISGylation (11, 24, 25). In humans, two isoforms of USP18 have been described: the USP18 isoform and the N-terminal
truncated USP18-sf isoform, which differ in their amino-terminal regions.
Although both isoforms are present in the cytoplasm, the USP18-sf isoform has
also been observed in the nucleus (22, 26). Hence, USP18 is mainly located in
the cytoplasm, while USP18-sf is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the
nucleus. Although both proteins maintain their enzymatic and IFNAR2 binding
abilities, the USP18-sf isoform is the main de-lSGylation enzyme for nuclear
proteins. In general, USP18 protein has been found in many tissues, including
the thymus, liver, spleen, lungs, bone marrow, adipose tissues (22), and various
cancerous tissues (27).
USP18 has been reported to be involved in several biological responses to
bacterial and viral infections (28–31), cell signaling pathways (16, 32–35),
autoimmunity (36), malignant neoplasms (37, 38), neurological disorders and
stress (39), and cardiac remodeling (40). Some studies have observed deregulated expression of USP18 in some cancer types (24, 27, 37), including in bladder cancer (41), breast cancer (42), melanoma (38), and lung cancer (43).
Interestingly, USP18 is also involved in the development of neurological
­disorders. Some studies involving mice with deficient USP18 have reported
many neurological problems, including tremors, seizures, and hydrocephalus
with a reduced lifespan (44, 45). Further studies are required to elucidate the
molecular pathways associated with the role of USP18 in different physiological
and pathological conditions. However, the role of USP18 as an IFN-signaling
regulator and a de-ISGylase seems to be central in cancer, particularly in malignant mammary tumors. Here, we discuss the modulation and functions of the
USP18 in breast cancer.

USP18 in Breast Cancer

IFN-I SIGNALING PATHWAY AND ITS REGULATION BY USP18
As previously mentioned, many signaling pathways are involved in the regulation
of USP18. It has been found that Usp18 is rapidly and strongly upregulated after
viral infection, LPS, TNF-α, genotoxic stress, and mainly by type I IFNs
(IFN-I) (22). It has been reported that pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A classic example of this signaling is the detection of viral RNA by retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and
toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (46). After recognizing these molecules, TLRs dimerize
and activate the production of IFNs (19, 47). IFN-I is an antiviral cytokine group
that includes several subtypes, among them IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, and
IFN-ω. The receptors for these IFNs are composed of two subunits, namely
IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which are associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and
Janus-activated kinase 1 (JAK1), respectively. Once IFN-I binds to its receptor,
dimerization and activation of associated kinases occur, promoting the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2.
Hence, phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1) and p-STAT2 assemble into a heterodimer, translocate to the nucleus, and form a trimer with interferon regulatory
­factor 9 (IRF9), leading to the generation of the interferon-stimulated gene ­factor 3
(ISGF3) complex. The ISGF3 complex then binds to the IFN promoter to induce
transcription (48). IFNs can modulate gene expression in a cell type-dependent
manner. One of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) is USP18 (16). USP18 expression
seems to be important for the antiviral response since it has been observed that
the absence of USP18 confers resistance to various viruses in mice (29, 49).
IFN-I treatment can induce apoptosis associated with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT (50, 51). However, this and other actions modulated by IFN-I can be
inhibited by USP18. Hence, IFN-I signaling via the JAK/STAT pathway is negatively regulated through the binding of USP18 to the IFNAR2 subunit, blocking
the binding of JAK1 to the IFN-I receptor complex (25, 49). This competitive
inhibition occurs because the C-terminal portion of USP18 binds to the Box1Box2 cytoplasmic region from the IFNAR2 intracellular domain, inhibiting the
binding of JAK1 kinase (25). Additionally, the C and N-terminal regions of USP18
bind to the intermediate part of STAT2, whose function is to bind DNA.
Furthermore, the removal of STAT2 can reduce the interaction between USP18
and IFNAR2 (35).
Several studies have demonstrated the importance of USP18 in IFN-I signaling. For example, USP18 knockout (KO) mice displayed brain damage and
decreased life expectancy, with inflammation and overactivation of the microglia,
characterized by STAT1/2 hyperphosphorylation and the overexpression of ISGs.
This USP18 KO phenotype is rescued by IFNAR1 depletion, demonstrating that
USP18 is a critical regulator of the IFN-I signaling pathway (24, 52). The phenotype of the USP18 KO animal model is in accordance with the observations in
humans reported by Meuwissen (52), where a USP18 mutation was found to
result in loss of function and absence of the protein. People with this mutation
develop Pseudo-TORCH syndrome, characterized by microcephaly and
­calcifications in the brain (52).

Ruxolitinib has been used to inhibit kinases in patients with USP18 deficiency
(53). Moreover, in the pancreas, USP18 inhibition leads to inflammation, IFNdependent B-cell apoptosis, and an increase in JAK/STAT signaling (54). Therefore,
USP18 has been proposed as a target to enhance the therapeutic effect of IFN
against viral infections or modulate IFN-I signaling in cancer (55–57). It is important to note that the deficiency of USP18 also affects other signaling pathways,
leading to increased NF-κB and TNF-α signaling, and high levels of conjugated
ISG15. Thus, these studies suggest that USP18 can also regulate itself through a
negative feedback mechanism, either by inhibiting the binding of JAK1 to the
IFNAR2 subunit, or by inhibiting the ubiquitination of the TAK1-TAB complex of
TNFR1, another inductor of USP18 expression (22).

USP18 AS A REGULATOR OF PROTEIN ISGYLATION
ISGylation is a post-translational modification that covalently adds ISG15 to
target proteins. ISG15 is a 15 kDa ubiquitin-like protein (58) generated by
removing eight amino acid residues at the C–terminal, and the N–terminal
methionine from a 165 amino acid long precursor protein of ISG15. The mature
form of ISG15 (15 kDa) consists of two Ub–like domains that are connected via
a “hinge” sequence. The C-terminus of ISG15 displays the motif LRLRGG,
which is required to covalently bind to its target proteins via the ISGylation
(59, 60). The ISGylation system is similar to ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like
protein systems, involving three enzymes, the E1 activating enzyme, the E2
conjugating enzyme, and the E3 ligase enzyme, which is the last enzyme responsible for covalently and specifically binding ISG15 to the target protein
(Figure 2). In particular, the ISGylation system consists of E1, E2, and only
three E3 ligases, namely HERC5, HHARI, and EFP/TRIM25 (61–64). However,
few ISGylation targets have been identified so far, in comparison with those of
other posttranslational modifications. ISGylation alters protein–protein interactions, modifications, as well as cellular activities (59). An important finding is
that USP18 de-ISGylates proteins and is therefore considered a critical means of
regulating ISGylation. Thus, protein de-ISGylation mediated by USP18 involves
releasing ISG15 in its free, non-conjugated state (12, 13).
USP18 without protease activity (USP18 C61A, inactive catalytic site) leads
to an increase in ISGylation but does not affect IFN production. Furthermore,
USP18 knock-in mice without enzymatic activity did not show IFN hypersensitivity, which indicated that the enzymatic activity is not related to other
USP18 functions (65). Moreover, some studies have shown that USP18 deficient mice display ISGylation enhancement (25, 45, 60, 66). Therefore, USP18
activity appears to be a mechanism to reduce protein ISGylation, promoting
the accumulation of free ISG15 (65, 67). Also, it has been reported that surviving USP18-deficient mice have high levels of conjugated ISG15, and display hydrocephalus and neurodegeneration (45). In addition, the deletion of
USP18 has been associated with an increase in ISGylation at the feto-maternal
interface (66).
As few ISGylation targets have been identified so far, the actions of USP18
on specific substrates have been completely defined. Interestingly, one study

USP18 in Breast Cancer

Figure 2. USP18 is a regulator of ISGylation. The protein ISGylation is mediated by the
E1-activating (UBE1L), E2-conjugating (UBCH8), and E3-ligase (HERC5, TRIM25, HHARI) for
ISG15. In this system, USP18 removes ISG15 from ISGylated protein.

identified a novel ISGylation target, protein phosphatase, and tensin homolog
(PTEN). PTEN is an important tumor suppressor protein that, when ISGylated,
becomes less stable. The authors observed that USP18 overexpression promoted
PTEN de-ISGylation, leading to an increase in its stability, whereas the reduction
of USP18 decreased PTEN stability. Thus, in lung cancer, a positive correlation
between USP18 and PTEN protein levels has been observed (68).

ISG15, USP18 and IFN-I signaling pathways
IFN-I signaling pathways can promote antiviral responses, have immunomodulatory effects, and inhibit cell proliferation. ISG15 has been found to be induced by
IFN-I and IFN-II (69, 70), associated with different cellular processes. For example, it has been reported that ISG15 KO mice are more susceptible to infection by
influenza viruses A and B, and by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (46, 71, 72),
while in the same mice with ISG15 deficiency, infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) does not appear to be
different from wild-type mice (73). Thus, ISG15 can exhibit antiviral activity
against some viruses, but not against others.

Tecalco-Cruz AC et al.

In addition, the functions of ISG15 depend on its status as a free or conjugated
protein. Free ISG15 acts as a cytokine that activates NK cells and CD8+ T cells,
promotes dendritic cell maturation, and participates in innate and adaptive
immune responses (46). Furthermore, free ISG15 is also present intracellularly,
regulating protein-protein interactions implicated in signaling pathways. Both
free ISG15 and ISGylation have been found to be associated not only with antiviral responses, but also with the pathology of several cancer types, including breast
cancer (59).
As USP18 is an inhibitor of IFN-I signaling, and a de-ISGylase, the interplay
between these two functions may be deregulated in some pathologies, including
cancer. It has been reported that intracellular free ISG15 can stabilize USP18 levels in humans. USP18 stability is conferred by the interaction between ISG15 and
USP18, which blocks its SKP2-induced degradation (34). Specifically, free ISG15
promotes the disassembly of SKP2 from USP18 to avoid degradation of USP18 (74).
Thus, intracellular-free ISG15 may contribute to the inhibition of IFN-I signaling
pathways by USP18.

USP18 AS A REGULATOR OF ISGYLATION OF BREAST
CANCER PROTEOME
Many studies have recently emerged on ISGylation in breast cancer. For
instance, in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, the use of interfering RNA
(siRNA) to reduce the expression of ISG15 leads to a decrease in the proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A similar result
is observed by the use of siRNA for UBCH8, an E2-conjugating enzyme for
ISG15 (75). In contrast, high levels of ISG15 or UBCH8 expression are correlated with enhancing the tumorigenic characteristics of breast cancer cells.
These actions of ISG15 have been related to protein ISGylation and its potential
to interfere with protein ubiquitination in breast cancer cells (75, 76).
Nevertheless, the same research group also demonstrated that in vivo ISG15 can
have antitumor effects based on xenotransplantation of ISG15 knockdown
ZR-75-1 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in athymic (nude) mice, showing
an increased tumor development and decreased of NK cells recruitment.
Interestingly, xenotransplanted MDA-MB-231 cells in athymic mice were
reduced by a subcutaneous injection of recombinant purified ISG15, and high
tumor NK cell infiltration and expression of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC II) were observed (77).
The reason behind the seemingly opposite effects of ISG15 on the tumorigenic
characteristics in vitro and in vivo, observed using siRNA, remains unclear.
However, the intracellular actions of free ISG15 and conjugated ISG15 may be
modulated by the interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, which
differ between in vitro and in vivo studies. Hence, the activity of extracellular free
ISG15 is cytokine-like and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in breast
cancer xenotransplants in athymic mice (77), suggesting that USP18 may play a
central role in the development of malignant mammary tumors. As USP18 facilitates the accumulation of free ISG15, de-ISGylation may transcend the progression of breast cancer (Figure 3).

USP18 in Breast Cancer

Figure 3. There is an interplay between USP18 and free ISG15. The de-ISGylation activity from
USP18 affects the levels of free ISG15 since USP18 removes ISG15 from ISGylated protein.
Free ISG15 can have extracellular functions as a cytokine-like protein and intracellularly by
modulating some protein interactions.

USP18 AND BREAST CANCER MICROENVIRONMENT
To investigate the effect of USP18 on breast cancer, Burkart et al. (78) performed
a study in which they used a polyomavirus middle T (PyVmT) mouse model for
breast cancer and included two groups: PyVmT/Usp18 KO and PyVmT/Usp18
wild type (WT). At 13 weeks of age, PyVmT/USP18 WT mice were sacrificed due
to the presence of multiple large tumors, while PyVmT/USP18 KO mice showed
a clear reduction in the size and number of visible tumors. This result may be
explained by the fact that PyVmT/USP18 KO tumors had a significant decrease in
CD31 positive cells, indicating an angiostatic effect of USP18 deficiency.
Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of activated CD4+ T cells was
observed in the tumors of PyVmT/Usp18 KO mice, compared to PyVmT/Usp18
WT mice. Interestingly, it was observed that PyVmT/USP18 KO mammary epithelial cells (MECs) secrete elevated levels of CXCL10, creating a Th1/M1-polarized
cytokine tumor environment, thereby exhibiting a Th1-like cytokine profile, characterized by increased IFN-γ and decreased IL-4 and IL-13 levels. Furthermore,
the authors reported that IFN-I promotes CXCL10 upregulation in MECs. As
USP18 is an inhibitor of IFN-I signaling, the absence of USP18 facilitates an IFNI-dependent CXCL10 upregulation. Knockdown of IL-28R1 in USP18-deficient
MECs dramatically enhanced tumor growth. This study suggests that USP18 may

139

140

Tecalco-Cruz AC et al.

be a regulator of the tumor microenvironment and is therefore a promising candidate for breast cancer immunotherapy (78).
In addition, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play critical roles in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Recently, it has been reported that CD10+ GPR77+
CAFs favor breast cancer stemness by providing a favorable microenvironment for
cancer stem cells. To identify critical co-expression modules and calculate
the module-trait relationship (MTR), Xu et al. (79) applied a weighted gene
­co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptomic data, from CAFs
­collected from chemoresistant or chemosensitive breast cancer patients before
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). As a result of this analysis, 12 modules were
determined; although only one of them was associated with CAF-related chemoresistance, and was related to “inflammatory response”, “interferon-gamma-­
mediated signaling”, and “NIK/NFκB signaling” pathways, and included the
enriched hub genes of CXCL8, CXCL10, CXCL11, PLSCR1, RIPK2 and USP18.
Moreover, the researchers validated these six genes by RT-qPCR and reported that
all of them showed a higher expression in the breast cancer CAFs of chemoresistant patients than those of the chemosensitive ones. Finally, the overall survival
data demonstrated that the prognosis of breast cancer patients was poorer when
these hub genes were highly expressed (79). These data indicate that USP18 is
part of a signature of genes implicated in breast cancer progression.

EGF/EGFR SIGNALING AND USP18 IN BREAST CANCER
The high complexity of oncogenic pathways has led to the pursuit of strategies
capable of inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, and among the studied factors
is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (80). EGFR is a tyrosine kinase
that triggers an intracellular signal transduction pathway, that promotes cellular proliferation; therefore, targeting EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, either
with inhibitors or with antibodies, has been proposed as a strategy for tumor
treatment (81). Interestingly, USP18 was identified as a candidate to regulate
EGFR. This study observed that the reduction of USP18 expression by a siRNA
leads to - miR7 upregulation, affecting the translation of miR7-target mRNAs,
one of them, EGFR. Thus, an increase in the miR7 levels due to the depletion
of USP18 generates a reduction in the EGFR protein levels. These events lead
to apoptosis, making EGFR modulation a potential new therapy for tumor
treatment (81).
In 2018, Tan et al. (42) performed bioinformatics analysis and in vivo experiments to explain the molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of USP18 on
the progression of breast cancer. They reported that low methylation in the promoter region of USP18 leads to its upregulation in breast cancer. Furthermore,
USP18 mRNA levels were positively correlated with the epithelial cell proliferation gene set, suggesting that USP18 promotes breast cancer cell growth, and was
negatively associated with the cell cycle arrest gene set and apoptosis gene set in
patients with breast cancer. These results demonstrate that USP18 may participate
in breast cancer development by promoting cell cycle progression and inhibiting
apoptosis. Moreover, USP18 expression was shown to increase EGFR expression
and activate the AKT/SKP2 pathway. Breast cancer patients with high USP18
and SKP2 expression had worse survival rates (42). Remarkably, USP18 was

USP18 in Breast Cancer

significantly upregulated in patients with HER2+ breast cancer, and increased
expression of USP18 and SKP2 was associated with the worst prognosis (42).
These results suggest that USP18 and SKP2 may be useful as markers in breast
cancer development.

USP18 AND THE TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER
Tamoxifen (TAM) is a SERM drug used for breast cancer treatment, as it interferes
with the expression of estrogen-regulated genes in breast cancer cells. Recently,
Fang et al. (82) conducted a study in which they showed that after a 72 h-treatment
with TAM, MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed a decreased cell growth rate in a dosedependent manner. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that TAM-treated MCF-7 cells,
when compared to the control culture cells, had 332 upregulated genes, including
the genes for STAT1, STAT2, EIF2AK2, TGM2, DDX58, PARP9, SASH1, RBL2, and
USP18; and 320 downregulated genes, including the genes for CCDN1, S100A9,
S100A8, ANXA1, and PGR. Thus, these results suggest that USP18 is an upregulated
gene by TAM. Furthermore, in human breast tumor tissues, mRNA levels of some
genes, among them USP18, were significantly higher in ERα+ breast cancer tissues
than in ERα- ones. Moreover, the mRNA levels of USP18 were significantly higher
in ERα+ tumor tissues than in their corresponding tumor-adjacent tissues. Taking
these results into account, it seems that the effects of TAM on breast cancer cells rely
on the regulation it exerts on the genes mentioned above, one of them being USP18,
which seems to be also involved estrogen signaling pathways (82).

FUTURE CHALLENGES IN ELUCIADITING THE ROLE OF
USP18 IN BREAST CANCER
Deubiquitinases remove ubiquitination and ISGylation modifications, which are
important posttranslational modifications influencing protein function (12). Prior
studies have revealed that USP18 acts by deISGylating substrate proteins; thus,
USP18-deficient mice showed increased levels of intracellular ISG15 conjugates,
and in vitro analysis showed that USP18 removes ISG15 from ISGylated proteins,
but it has no effect on modified proteins by other ubiquitin-like proteins (12, 65).
This finding suggests that USP18 is an ISG15-specific protease. However, there are
particular challenges to be addressed in the future. The first challenge is the need for
additional studies to identify ISGylation targets and elucidate how ISGylation affects
protein functions in several biological processes, including breast cancer progression (27). Consequently, it will be possible to understand the implications of deISGylation of these proteins by USP18 in mammary tumorigenesis.
A second challenge is the demonstration and application of USP18 as a
target of antineoplastic strategies, based on the observation that USP18 mRNA
and protein levels are high in most types of cancer, including breast cancer,
and that inhibition of USP18 expression is associated with favorable cancerspecific survival (41). Individuals expressing low levels of USP18 had a higher
survival percentage than those that expressed high levels, suggesting that
upregulation of USP18 is a significant risk factor for cancer-related death (10).

141

Tecalco-Cruz AC et al.

Thus, specific inhibitors of USP18 may be used as novel breast cancer therapeutics. Furthermore, with the crystal structure of murine USP18 being solved
in isolation and in combination with ISG15, it will be easier to develop the
next generation of USP18 inhibitors and search for antineoplastic effects (27).
Determining the effect of USP18 on the ISGylome of human breast cancer cells
represents another challenge. A study demonstrated that ISGylation is not
involved in protein degradation; instead, ISGylation is involved in protein
stabilization, perhaps through co-translational modification in chronic
myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, they showed that USP18 deficiency sensitizes cancer cells to radiotherapy in a dose-dependent manner, probably by
interfering with IFN signaling, and that USP18-deficient cells are more antigenic, which enhances the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (83).
Moreover, USP18 has also been associated with inflammation and resistance
to chemotherapy, and USP18 inhibition has been suggested to improve the
response during chemotherapy (10, 51). Thereby, the multifunctionality of
USP18 may also be critical in breast cancer progression and the response to
therapeutic strategies (Figure 4).

Figure 4. USP18 in breast cancer. USP18 modulates molecular pathways activated by IFNs,
ISG15/ISGylation, and EGFR in breast cancer cells. The USP18 mRNA/protein levels are
increased in breast cancer tissue, mainly in the ERα+ and HER2-overexpressing subtypes.

USP18 in Breast Cancer

Finally, considering the functional complexity of ISG15 in the context of breast
cancer, another challenge will be to decode the activity of USP18 in ISG15dependent and independent pathways involved in the progression of malignant
mammary tumors. Likewise, it is required to integrate the role of USP18 in ISG15dependent and independent pathways in breast cancer.

CONCLUSION
USP18 is a multifunctional protein, and additional studies are required to fully
elucidate its role in breast cancer. Moreover, its function as a negative regulator of
IFN-I pathway, and as an enzyme that modulates ISGylation, leads to the hypothesis that USP18 may be centrally involved in the development and progression of
breast cancer. Consequently, USP18 may be useful as a biomarker, as well as a
novel molecular target for new therapeutic strategies in this pathology.

Abstract: Breast cancer represents 16% of all malignant tumors diagnosed and is
the leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. While significant advances in
the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer have been made over the years, the
management of advanced stages of the disease and treatment-related adverse
events continue to be a challenge. There is a need to develop tools for target-­
specific delivery of drugs to improve efficiency and decrease non-specific druginduced toxicity. The field of nanotechnology has undergone a rapid revolution
and nanostructures of carbon have produced some promising results in the
­treatment of breast cancer, at least in experimental settings. This chapter provides
an overview of the emerging role of carbon nanomaterials for the treatment of
breast cancer with emphasis on graphene, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nano
diamonds, and carbon dots. The promises and challenges are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer type diagnosed in women and is the
primary cause of mortality due to cancer in women around the world (1).
According to GLOBOCAN 2018, more than 2.05 million new cases were diagnosed, and incidence is expected to increase by more than 46% by 2040 (2). The
type and severity of breast cancer depends on the cell of origin. The breast is made
up of three main parts: connective tissue, lobules, and ducts. Most breast cancers
start in the lobes and the ducts (Figure 1). Based on its molecular subtypes, breast
cancer can be categorized as luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth
­factor receptor 2 (HER2) type, and estrogen (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)positive (3). Among these categories, the ER/PR positive subtypes contribute
approximately 70% of all reported cases (4). On the other hand, 20% of the
reported cases are associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a specific
subtype of breast cancer that does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), making
this class not sensitive to endocrine therapy or HER2 treatment (5). TNBC shows
specific clinical features that include high invasiveness, high metastatic potential,
proneness to relapse, and poor prognosis. Approximately 46% of TNBC patients
will have distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (6).
The list of drugs used in the clinic to treat breast cancer is extensive and
includes tamoxifen, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and epirubicin, among several ­others.
The side effects caused by the direct application of these drugs include neutropenia, lymphedema, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, trouble thinking, pain, blood
clots (deep vein thrombosis) and others. These effects also occur when therapy
involves radiation, which is a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to
kill cancer cells and shrink tumors (7). Some open questions for investigation are:
How to correct side effects? How to deliver drugs directly to the cancer cell? How
to know if the drug is in the right place? Nanotechnology offers a possibility to
address these questions. Now, we can design and manufacture various types of
nanoparticles, including metallic or their oxides, as well as nanocomposites that

can deliver drugs to a specific target place. In the case of cancer, part of its diagnosis and treatment has been done by using gold nanoparticles, silica n
­ anoparticles
coated with gold, nanopolymers that carry the drug and/or carbon nanostructures
showing easy penetration into the cell due to their hydrophobicity (8). This chapter provides an overview of the emerging role of carbon nanomaterials for the
treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer.

CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES
Since the discovery of fullerene C60 (9), carbon-derived nanostructures have
become one of the most prominent research areas, and most of these studies
have focused on C60 and carbon nanotubes. Their ability to present in different
­allotropic forms has led to a great diversity of nanostructures with fascinating
geometries and properties (10). This includes nanostructures such as fullerenes,
graphenes, carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds, and nano-onions, all of which
are allotropes of carbon (Figure 2). Fullerenes are carbon molecules that can take
­different geometric shapes such as sphere, ellipsoid, tube, or ring. Graphene is a
structure with atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern. Carbon nanotubes
are cylindrical structures that can be single-walled or multi-walled. Nanodiamonds
are nanostructures that have the crystalline phase of diamond. And finally,
­nano-onions have a multilayer graphene structure. In principle, all of these nano
compounds can undergo modifications in their structure through acid attacks
mainly, which allows the generation of carboxyl or hydroxyl radicals that
facilitate their functionalization with different molecules through different
­
types of bonds.
The properties of nanostructures are characterized using various techniques
including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS used to determine the type
of bonds), X-ray diffraction (XRD to determine crystallinity), TEM and SEM
(to determine size and agglomeration level), and FT-IR and RAMAN (to find
functional groups). The functionalization of a carbon nanostructure involves several synthesis steps. It must include a recognition entity such as a monoclonal
antibody or another molecule that recognizes a site expressing a signal to which
it can bind to (Figure 3), a molecule that can be detected by a specific wavelength, and finally, the specific drug for the type of cancer (e.g., breast cancer).
Recent studies indicate that early detection and targeted therapy can help
decrease deaths due to breast cancer, representing a way in which carbon nanostructures can be applied (11). Next, we cite carbon nanostructures and their
uses against breast cancer.

Graphene in breast cancer
A bioactive multifunctional CePO4/CS/GO scaffold––formed by the combination
of graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles, CePO4 nanobars and bioactive chitosan
(CS)––shows characteristics of photothermal therapy in killing tumors, generating macrophage polarization, promoting blood vessels formation, and induction
of bone formation. This scaffold may become a promising platform for the treatment of breast cancer bone metastases by destroying residual bone tumor cells
after photothermal therapy and subsequent healing of the bone defects (12).
Similarly, graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites, loaded with superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles spliced with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and grafted with
methotrexate and stimulus-sensitive linkers (GO-SPION-MTX), have been developed for photothermal and chemotherapy of breast cancer. GO-SPION-MTX
nanocomposites are internalized by folate receptor-positive cancer cells and
induce high cytotoxicity when exposed to near infrared (NIR) lasers (13). Table 1
summarizes some of the key studies on the use of graphene in breast cancer.
Stimulus-sensitive polyelectrolyte nanoparticles have been developed for the
chemo-photothermal destruction of breast cancer cells. This novel system, called
layer by layer (LBL) Lipo-graph, is composed of alternating layers of graphene
oxide (GO) and poly (L-lysine) conjugated to graphene oxide (GO-PLL) deposited on cationic liposomes that encapsulate doxorubicin. Toxicity tests showed
that LBL Lipo-graph can effectively kill MD-MB-231 cells after NIR irradiation.
The presence of GO-PLL in the outer layer of LBL Lipo-graph can increase cell
uptake and can also increase drug accumulation within cells (23). In a study
reported in 2021 (24), graphene oxide nanoparticles (HA-GO-Met) loaded with
metformin grafted with hyaluronic acid (HA) exhibited anticancer efficacy at
much lower doses compared to metformin alone. HA-GO-Met nanoparticles
induced apoptosis and inhibited cell migration of triple negative breast cancer
cells by targeting the miR-10b/PTEN axis through NFκB-p65. Treatment with
HA-GO-Met nanoparticles reduced tumor burden and abolished tumor-borne
toxicity in peripheral organs, exhibiting anticancer efficacy in TNBC cells both in
vivo and in vitro as well.
Complexes that include photoluminescent graphene quantum dots with glucosamine as a targeting agent, and with curcumin as an anticancer agent, have
been proven to inhibit cells of the MCF-7 breast cancer line, a result that sounds

promising due to the observed behavior pH-sensitive, sustained release for nanoassembly (25). Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) Quantum Dots synthesized
through the usual calcination method served as nanoplatforms for dual twophoton excited photodynamic therapy (TPE-PDT) and two-photon imaging
(TPI) (26). In a recent review, it has been discussed that the combination of ­carbon
nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, graphene and nanodiamonds, in combination with nuclear medicine isotopes, can be useful for the
diagnosis of various types of cancer including breast cancer (27). In contrast, in a
study aimed at following the targeting of doxorubicin conjugated with gold-doped
mesoporous silica nanoparticles and graphene quantum dots, it was observed that
cell viability was lower when doxorubicin alone was used. (28).

Fullerenes in breast cancer
Molecular coupling studies have shown that letrozole, a drug commonly used for
the treatment of breast cancer, has greater biological activity and improvement
when forming a self-assembly with sheets of graphene and fullerenes compared to
the single molecule (29). Studies indicate that targeted hyperthermia has a high
potential to become a cancer treatment modality, although it must be precisely
controlled to avoid damaging adjacent healthy tissues. The use of an array
consisting of emitters of quantum dots arranged in a buckyball shape demonstrated
that it is possible to control super-radiance using an external electric field, which
indicates that the use of a series of super-radiant pulses can improve breast cancer
hyperthermia by minimizing damage to adjacent healthy tissues (30). Table 2
presents some of the most recent studies of fullerenes used for the diagnosis and
treatment of breast cancer.

Nanomaterials for Breast Cancer

Carbon nanotubes
Breast cancer causes metabolic disturbances and thus, volatile metabolites in the
breath of patients can be used to diagnose the disease. Yang et al., developed an
electronic nose composed of carbon nanotube sensors resulting in 86% sensitivity
and 97% specificity, while the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.99.
These electronic nose breath tests can be applied intraoperatively to discriminate
breast cancer and/or identify molecular subtypes, helping medical staff choose the
best treatment decision (35).
Oxidized graphene nanoribbons, decorated with folic acid and loaded with a
selective estrogen receptor modulator (tamoxifen citrate), were prepared from
multi-walled carbon nanotubes, the results showed a drug loading efficiency of
56%, concentration and time-dependent apoptosis, and a preferential cellular
internalization, which might represent a promising platform for the efficient and
selective delivery of tamoxifen to breast cancer cells (36).
Similarly, Adabi et al. designed and developed an electrochemical
immunosensor, based on an electrospun carbon nanofiber mat, for the detection
of Her-2. The sensor was modified with Au nanoparticles, cysteamine molecules,
carbon nanotubes, and specific antibodies. The results indicated that the designed
immunosensor has a high potential for the determination of Her-2 given its noninvasive, precise, and fast analysis (37).
Dopamine and mucin-1 functionalized electroactive carbon nanotubes have
also been synthesized as signal generating probes for the construction of
electrochemical immunosensors for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The
developed immunosensor permitted the detection of MUC-1 in the linear range of
0.05-940 U/mL, with a detection limit of 0.01 U/mL (38). Table 3 shows some of
the most recent studies of carbon nanotubes used for the diagnosis and treatment
of breast cancer.

Nanodiamonds
Nanodiamonds are one of the most promising carbon nanostructures in
biomedicine due to their unique properties: they are biocompatible, have low
toxicity, are mechanically and chemically stable, show stable photoluminescence,
and have a multifunctional and easily modifiable surface, among others (46).
Hyperthermia is one of the methods to attack malignant tumors (47). Therefore,
a group of researchers synthesized nanodiamonds using high pressure and
temperature, doped them with boron and tested them on MCF7 cells. These
nanostructures were proven to be more efficient than nanodiamonds obtained by
detonation due to their significant capacity to absorb infrared light, which hold
promise for their use in hyperthermia and thermoablation of tumors. (48).
In other studies, drugs such as melittin, the main component of bee venom, have
been tested. When administered alone, melittin’s toxic effects on cancer cells were
lower than when administered using a carbon nanostructure (49). Polyglycerolcoated nanodiamonds-conjugated doxorubicin were pH-sensitive to hydrazone
bonding. When the complex was compared to DOX in free form, the complex
induced endoplasmic reticulum stress without substantial DNA damage,
while DOX caused massive damage in DNA, as well as stress in endoplasmic
reticulum (50). Table 4 summarizes some of the latest reports on the use of NDs
in the treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer.

Carbon dots
Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging subset of nanomaterials, defined by
characteristic sizes of <10 nm. CDs possess a carbon core that is functionalized by
various groups at the surface (55). These materials possess physicochemical
properties, such as photo-induced electron transfer and photoluminescence, high
biocompatibility, and low toxicity, making them potential materials for biosensing,
drug delivery and bioimaging, making them useful for the diagnosis and treatment
of breast cancer (56).
For the treatment of breast cancer, CDs were synthesized and functionalized with
doxorubicin (CDs-DOX), finding that, compared to free doxorubicin, the CDs-DOX
complex had a higher cellular uptake and better anti-tumor efficacy on MCF-7 cells
(57). Recently, the development of N-hydroxyphthalimide-derived carbon dots
doped with gadolinium, Fe3+ and Mn2+ was reported. Normal and cancerous cell
lines were treated with doped carbon dots, and cell viability was measured, obtaining
that Mn2+ doped Carbon Dots (Mn-CDs-NHF) presented antitumor properties,

without affecting the cell viability of normal cells, and reduce the volume of primary
mammary tumors while allowing magnetic resonance imaging. Suggesting that they
can be used as theranostic agents in preclinical models (58).
The use of biomarkers for the diagnosis of breast cancer is of great significance,
among them is microRNA-21, whose expression is increased and is a biomarker
for early-stage breast cancer detection. Recently, a 3D hydrogel based on carbon
dots and chitosan was fabricated for sensitive quantification of micRNA-21 in
MCF-7 cancer cells. The DNA hydrogel bioassay strategy revealed a great stability
and a superb sensitivity for microRNA-21, with a suitable linear range (0.1–125
fM) and a detection limit (0.03 fM). Thus, it is suggested that nanocomposite
hydrogels can be used for multicolor imaging of MCF-7 cancer cells (59).
Carbon dots have a tissue penetration that varies according to their
luminescence and are ideal for imaging. However, their drawback is that they
degrade in the body before reaching the target cells. Xu et al. (60) recently reported
a study combining carbon dots with mesoporous organosilica nanocapsules
(MON-CDs) and found that after 1 h of incubation in breast cancer cells, the
nanoparticles were found close to the cell membrane and after 2 h the nanoparticles
were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm, suggesting that MON-CDs possess
near-infrared luminescence and have good imaging capabilities in confocal
microscopy and photoacoustic imaging. In another study, a novel dual-element
sensor array based on two CDs was constructed. Interestingly, the sensor array
distinguished cancer patients (liver and breast cancers) from healthy people
and discriminated and quantified amyloidogenic proteins with high accuracy
demonstrating its potential for rapid cancer detection on a large scale (61). All
these studies indicate that CDs have potential use in the treatment and diagnosis
of breast cancer.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The most recent advances in the use of carbon nanostructures as vehicles to
deliver drugs specifically to cancerous tumors, offers the possibility to minimize
damage to healthy cells or reduce the side effects that affect the patient, can be a
very useful tool for this purpose. We have learned to generate modifications on
the surface of such nanostructures, generating groups capable of binding with
drugs, especially those that can inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells and
with molecules capable of recognizing such cells, specific antibodies and
compounds such as lactate, among others. It is worth noting that antibiotic such
as tamoxifen can recognize estrogen receptors and therefore, can act as a
recognition molecule. Thus, the combination of a nanostructure with an antibiotic
or anticancer drug with a specific molecule that recognizes only the cancer cells,
and a quantum dot that emits a fluorescent signal under a certain wavelength may
enable early diagnosis of breast cancer. These examples show how carbon
nanostructures can be useful for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer
during the early stage of the disease even if there are just a few malignant cells.
However, additional studies using different breast cancer cell lines must be carried
out to evaluate the toxicity of the nanostructure alone and the complexes that are
formed with it to guarantee patient safety.

Nanomaterials for Breast Cancer

CONCLUSION
These examples show how carbon nanostructures can be useful for the diagnosis
and treatment of breast cancer during the early stage of the disease, even when
stage one is incipient with the presence of just a few malignant cells, thus
representing their promising use by physicians in the clinic. However, additional
studies at the laboratory level using different breast cancer cell lines must be
carried out to evaluate the toxicity of both the nanostructure alone and the
complexes that are formed with it in order to guarantee patient safety.

Abstract: In 2020, female breast cancer overtook lung cancer to become the most
diagnosed cancer worldwide. Nearly 30% of women diagnosed with early-stage
breast cancer have recurrent disease with resistance to therapeutics evidenced in
25% of cases. The hormone receptor positive (ER+ and PR+) and HER2+ breast
cancers quickly develop resistance to the frontline therapeutics, namely, endocrine therapy and trastuzumab treatment. The overactivity of the PI3K/mTOR/
S6K1 pathway has been shown to lead to multidrug resistant breast cancer. While
PI3K and mTOR targeted therapeutics have shown promise, development of resistance and mutations in these proteins have limited the success of these agents.
S6K1 kinase, a downstream effector whose activation leads to translation of
ribosomal proteins, enhancement of mRNA biogenesis, and cap-dependent
­
­translation and elongation, is a critical player in the PI3K/mTOR pathway and the
ER+ pathway. Inhibiting the activity of S6K1 can provide the needed therapeutic
option for resistant/refractory breast cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION
The ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta family of genes RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2
encode several proteins that are serine threonine kinases (1). Alternate use mRNA
translational AUG start codons on RPS6KB1 is known to generate distinct isoforms of the protein: p70S6K1, p85S6K1, (2, 3), p60S6K1, and p31S6K1 (4, 5).
p85S6K1, the larger isoform, includes the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in
the N-terminus with a 23 amino acid extension which was initially thought to be
constitutively nuclear (5–7) but recent studies based on nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation show its presence in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells (5, 8). p70S6K1
is thought to be mostly localized in the cytoplasm but studies have shown it to
accumulate in the nucleus leading to the conclusion that p70S6K1 may transit
between the cytoplasm and nucleus of the cell (5, 9). The scant literature on the
shorter isoform p31S6K1 only indicate it to be located in the nuclei of human
normal fibroblasts (8). Through phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation, S6K1 is involved in protein synthesis, cellular growth,
metabolism, cell structure and organization, aging and adiposity, memory, immunity, and muscle hypertrophy (3). Two isoforms, p70S6K1 and p85S6K1, have
been extensively studied as these are the targets for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation and play an important role in cancer progression,
enhanced cell viability, migration, and resistance to existing therapeutics (10).

S6K1 STRUCTURE AND REGULATION
S6K1 isoforms belong to the AGC serine/threonine protein kinase family. The
shorter isoform p70S6K1 has 502 residues and the longer isoform p85S6K1 has
525 residues with the additional NLS 23 residues in the N-terminus. The kinase
domains of both isoforms have identical sequences. Eight phosphorylation sites
(residue numbers based on p70S6K1 sequence) have been identified in the catalytic domain (Thr229), linker region (Ser371, Thr389 and Ser404), and the putative autoinhibitory region (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421 and Ser424) (11–13) as
shown in Figure 1A. The four residues in the autoinhibitory region need to be
phosphorylated initially to expose the residues in the catalytic domain and the
linker region for phosphorylation. PDK1 phosphorylates Thr229 on S6K1 which
is in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Thr389 which is in the hydrophobic motif is the target for mTOR phosphorylation. Both of these phosphorylations
are essential for the catalytic activation of the kinase (12). It has been proposed
that in the autoinhibitory inactive state, the C-terminus pseudosubstrate domain
of S6K1, which is basic in nature, interacts with the N-terminus, which is acidic,
and blocks the key phosphorylation sites in the kinase domain (14). Initiation of
activation is facilitated by a calcium-dependent priming step (15), followed by
sequential phosphorylation of the C-terminus residues (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421
and Ser424) (16) inducing a conformational change opening up the phosphorylation sites on the T-loop, the turn motif, and hydrophobic motif. Phosphorylated
T-loop induces critical conformational change to the active form of S6K1.
Phosphorylated turn motif stabilizes the phosphorylated hydrophobic motif that

S6K1 AND BREAST CANCER
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide with 2.3 million new diagnosis and 685,000 deaths globally in 2020. In the United States, the estimated
number of new breast cancer diagnosis is 281,550 with 43,600 deaths in the year
2021. There are four main types of breast cancer: luminal A (estrogen receptor
[ER] and progesterone receptor [PR- positive status and corresponding human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative status); luminal B (ER, PR,
and HER2-positive status); HER2-enriched (HER2+) with ER and PR-negative
status; and the triple-negative (ER, PR and HER2-negative status). Triple-negative

breast cancer has the worst prognosis followed by the HER2+, luminal B, and
luminal A. Luminal A is low-grade and has the best prognosis. The PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway has a major role in cell metabolism, cell growth, cell proliferation,
apoptosis and angiogenesis (19). This pathway is one of the most mutated pathways leading to altered protein functions and aberrant phosphorylation (Figure 2)
(20, 21). Activation of mTOR is the hallmark of several cancers including breast
cancer where it is highly deregulated and plays a key role on tumorigenesis (22).

Figure 2. S6K1 is activated by coordinated phosphorylation by mTORC1 and PDK1. Growth
factors, mitogens, and amino acids activate S6K1 through the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1, MAPK, IRS
pathways. Activated S6K1 regulates several cellular processes by phosphorylation of
substrates: mRNA processing via S6K1 Aly/REF-like target (SKAR), nuclear cap-binding protein
subunit 1(CBP80); cap-dependent translation initiation via programmed cell death protein 4
(PDCD4) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (elF4B); translation elongation via
eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K); protein folding via T-complex protein 1 subunit
beta (CCTβ); cell growth/size via ribosomal protein S 6 (rpS6); synaptic plasticity via fragile X
mental retardation protein (FMRP); cell survival via glycogen synthase kinase β (GSK3β),
Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD); transcription via transcription factors estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα) and cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREMT). ERK, extracellularsignal-regulated kinase; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; GRB2, growth factor receptor

mTOR can associate with either Raptor or Rictor to form two distinct complexes
mTORC1 or mTORC2 (23–25). Activated mTORC1 phosphorylates the key substrates p70S6K1 and elongation initiation factor (EIF)-4E binding protein 1
(4EBP1). Activated p70S6K1 promotes ribosome biogenesis and the translation of
cell growth and cell division proteins including IRS1, CREMt, ERa, SKAR, FMRP,
S6, BAD, GSK3, p21 and Cyclin D1 (26–32). mTORC1 is the downstream regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway which is activated in 60% of breast cancers
(33–35). PI3K pathway indirectly activates mTORC1 mainly through AKT.
Phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) by AKT results in its
­dissociation from TSC1/2 which is a negative regulator of mTORC1 activator
RHEB. Additionally, AKT phosphorylates PRAS40 that is associated with Raptor
and is an inhibitor of mTORC1 leading to dissociation of Raptor resulting in
mTORC1 activation. ERK and RSK in the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway can also
phosphorylate TSC2 which then initiates RHEB-mediated activation of mTORC1
(36). Other triggers for mTORC1 activation are intracellular ATP, glucose, and
certain amino acids (leucine, arginine, and glutamine) (37).

RPS6KB1 gene amplification
The chromosomal region 17q22-17q23 is found to be often amplified in breast
cancer (38). High copy number amplification of RPS6KB1 gene (≥3 copies),
which is in the 17q23 genomic region, is evidenced in 10.7% of breast cancer
while some amount of amplification of the RPS6KB1 gene is also seen in several
other types of cancer (4, 38). Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human
breast tissue, benign and malign breast tissues have clearly shown that S6K1 is
overexpressed in cancerous breast tissues when compared to normal breast tissues (39, 40). A study of 368 patients indicated increased risk of locoregional
recurrence in breast cancer with an associated p70S6K1 overexpression and
established p70S6K1 as a prognostic marker for locoregional recurrence indicating a key role (41). In a study of the global whole genome mRNA levels of S6K1
overexpressed tumors using the publicly available van de Vijver cohort (n = 295)
showed ­positive association with RPS6 and PI3KCA mRNA in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway (42).

S6K1 and receptor tyrosine kinases in breast cancer
HER2, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belong to the ERBB family of
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs- EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4)) that stimulate
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 pathways. Overexpression of HER2 is evidenced in
20–30% of breast cancers (43) with the HER2 gene amplification being the main
cause. While ligand binding activates EGFR, HER2 does not directly bind to any
ligands for activation. Homo- and heterodimerization induce autophosphorylation in the intracellular kinase domain of these receptors (44). HER2-targeted
therapies include antibodies that prevent dimerization in the extracellular
domains, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, and reversible/irreversible ATPcompetitive inhibitors of the kinase domain (lapatinib/neratinib) (45). These
therapeutics have greatly improved the 5-year survival rates of luminal A/B
­
breast cancer patients. Resistance to these therapeutics develop often with intrinsic HER2 alterations, constitutive activation of downstream PI3K pathway due to

167

168

Sridhar J et al.

the activating mutation of downstream proteins, overexpression other ERBB family members and RTKs such as insulin-growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1), fibroblast growth factor receptor-4 (FGFR4), and inactivation of tumor suppressor
proteins (46–51). About 70% of HER2-positive breast cancer patients develop
de novo or acquired resistance to trastuzumab leading to refractory metastatic
breast cancer (52, 53). It has been shown that intense trastuzumab treatment
induces PDK1 and mTORC1 phosphorylated activation of S6K1 exclusively in
trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells leading to the suggestion that S6K1 can
function as an early biomarker of trastuzumab resistance and a viable target for
inhibition for the treatment of refractory breast cancer (54).
Triple-negative breast cancers involve several pathways leading to cell division,
cell growth, cell migration, and metastasis. The most prominent among these
pathways is the EGFR overexpression and activation resulting in increased resistance to conventional therapies (55). It has been shown that anti-EGFR targeted
therapies are beneficial for triple-negative breast cancers but have failed to demonstrate significant clinical efficacy as a standalone therapy. This lack of significant
efficacy has been attributed to the constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway due to other genetic aberrations. A combination therapy approach that
co-targets multiple proteins in this pathway may achieve efficient therapeutic
effect for triple-negative breast cancer (56). Recent studies on the inhibition of
S6K1 with the specific inhibitor PF-4708671 have shown promising potent antimetastatic effect on triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (57).
FGFR4, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family, is overexpressed in 30% of breast cancers (58). FGFR in conjunction with HER2 regulates
the activity of cyclin D1 through MAPK and AKT/S6K1 pathways (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Model of regulation of cyclin D1 expression by collaboration between FGFR-4 and
HER2 pathways leading to cell proliferation proposed by Koziczak and Hynes (61).

RPS6K1 for Refractory Breast Cancer

Based on the cell type and nature of the activating RTK, S6K1 stimulation occurs
resulting in translational control of cyclin D1. Depletion of S6K1 by siRNA
resulted in the reduction of S6 phosphorylation that led to a 20–30% decrease in
cyclin D1 levels (59).

S6K1 and estrogen receptor alpha in breast cancer
Estrogen dependence is evidenced in 60% of breast cancers and targeted therapy
with endocrine treatments such as antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors have
been frontline in clinical settings (60). Unfortunately, only 50% of ER+ breast
cancers respond to endocrine treatments, and resistance develops eventually (60).
The MAPK, PI3K and mTORC1 pathways have been implicated in resistance
development in ER+ breast cancer leading to a deeper exploration of close interaction between the mTORC1/S6K1 and ER signaling (61). S6K1 can directly phosphorylate estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) on Ser167 in a ligand independent
manner resulting in increased ERα transcriptional activity and enhanced cell proliferation (Figure 4) (62). Furthermore, estrogen induces the overexpression of
S6K1 leading to the development and progression of breast cancer (63). The costimulatory relationship between ERα and S6K1 was evident in driving cell proliferation in low serum conditions with S6K1 able to partially rescue ERα
knockdown (61, 64). Interestingly, S6K1 promoted ERα activation even in the
absence of estrogen, leading to stimulation of cell proliferation and tumor transformation (61, 64, 65).
Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), an orphan nuclear factor and a master
regulator of cellular energy metabolism, is an essential regulator of tumor

Figure 4. Positive co-regulatory mechanism of S6K1 and ERα. Estrogen binding and
phosphorylation by S6K1 activates ERα leading to its dissociation of heat shock proteins
(HSPs) and dimerization. ERα dimer translocates to the nucleus where it activates the
promoter region of RPS6KB1 and upregulates the transcription of S6K1 mRNA resulting in a
positive feed-forward loop.

development as it provides for the energy needs of proliferating tumor cells
(66, 67). ERRα expression is significantly increased in triple-negative breast cancer and ERα-negative breast cancers. MDA-MB-231 cells with reduced expression
of ERRα showed increased expression levels of S6K1 mRNA and protein levels in
conjunction with downregulation of ERα. ERRα was found to negatively regulate
S6K1 expression by directly binding to its promoter, and inhibition of ERRα
under low serum conditions resulted in increased expression of S6K1 due to
increase in RPS6KB1 gene expression (68).

TARGETING S6K1 FOR BREAST CANCER THERAPY
The importance of S6K1 in cell growth, cell proliferation, and metastasis is clearly
evident in most types of breast cancers and thus S6K1 inhibition is emerging as a
highly potential strategy for resistant/metastatic/refractory breast cancer. Frequent
mutations in PI3K and PTEN lead to hyperactivation of mTOR and S6K1 (69, 70).
Resistance to mTORC1 therapeutic rapamycin in cancer cells has been attributed
to MAPK interacting kinase (MNK) which promoted subcomplex formation
between MNK and mTORC1while decreasing the binding of DEPTOR (an mTOR
inhibitor) to mTORC1 (71–74). Certain studies have hinted on S6K1 activation
occurs by the action of eIF4E which is activated by MNK upon prolonged exposure to rapamycin (75). S6K1 hyperactivation has also been evidenced in breast
cancers with mutations in IGF-1R, HER2, and FGFR (76). Additionally, RPS6KB1
gene gain in ER+ breast cancer cells were a predictor of poor prognosis with S6K1
indicated as an important kinase for the growth of long-term estrogen deprived
MCF7/LTED cells (77). All of these studies indicate that therapeutic intervention
using S6K1 inhibitors can help for breast cancer cells that are resistant to current
therapeutics.
In response to the evidenced role of S6K1 in resistant and refractory cancers,
pharmaceutical companies have launched drug discovery efforts for S6K1
ATP-competitive inhibitors. Several compounds have been identified as S6K1
inhibitors belonging to the structural classes of indazoles, imidazoles, benzimidazoles, ureas, thiones, phenylpyrazoles, pyrozolopyrimidines, isoindolinones and
organometallics (Figure 5).

PF-4708671
Pfizer developed the first specific S6K1 inhibitor PF-4708671 (IC50 of 0.160 µM),
a benzimidazole derivative, along with 77 other protein kinases including 13 AGC
kinase family members and its closest homolog S6K2 (IC50 = 65 µM) (78). RSK1,
RSK2 and MSK1 were the other kinases inhibited by PF-4708671 (IC50 = 4.7 µM,
9.2 µM and 0.95 µM, respectively). PF-4708671 decreased phosphorylation of
ribosomal protein S6 in HEK-293 cells. PF-4708671 has been used as the standard S6K1 inhibitor for the investigation of the role of S6K1 in several cancers.
PF-4708671 in combination with tamoxifen was shown to be highly effective
against ER+ MCF7 cells that had overexpression of S6K1 (79) and enhanced cell

death in glucose-starved MCF7 cells via downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin (80). The inhibitory effect of PF-4708671 on the AKT/
mTOR/S6K1 pathway led to the inhibition of cell migration in triple-negative
MDA-MB-231 cells and inhibition of local relapse in mice models (57, 81).

FS-115
The structure of the compound FS-115 has not been disclosed. FS-115 is reported
to be a specific inhibitor of S6K1 (IC50 = 0.035 µM), S6K2 (IC50 = 2.06 µM), and
AKT2 (IC50 = 23.8 µM). FS-115 showed high efficacy in the growth inhibition of

171

172

Sridhar J et al.

the triple-negative MBA-MD-231 cells with good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile (82). Initial preclinical trials have indicated FS-115 is well
tolerated in breast cancer patients with efficient suppression of distant metastasis
formation (82).

LY2584702
Eli Lilly identified a 4-aminopyrazolopyrimidine molecule LY2584702, an inhibitor of p70S6K1, as an anti-tumor agent in advanced solid tumors in phase I and
phase II trials (83, 84). LY2584702 was used to study the effect of S6K1 inhbition
on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to establish phosphorylated S6K1 levels
as prognostic marker for NSCLC patients. LY2584702 was found to suppress
­proliferation of NSCLC cells in-vitro (85).

Other heterocycles and urea derivatives
A series of pyrazolopyrimidines developed at Exelixis and derivatives e­ xhibited
selectivity for S6K1 (IC50 = 0.002 µM), Rsk2, PKA, AKT1 and AKT2 (IC50 values
of 0.068, 0.042, 0.371 and 3.021 µM, respectively). Initial in-vivo xenograft studies on PC3 prostate cancer cell lines showed promising efficacy (86). The active
ingredient of the immunosuppressive drug leflunomide, an isoxazole derivative
A77 1726, inhibited S6K1 with an IC50 value of 0.080 µM. It was shown that A77
1726 exerted anti-proliferative effects in lymphocytes and tumor cells, and
induced autophagy in part by inhibiting S6K1 activity (87). A series of
3-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazole derivatives developed by Vertex pharmaceuticals and
Biofocus were found to be potent and selective inhibitors of S6K1. Two of these
derivatives the 5-hydroxy-4-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-amine and
5-amino-4-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-amine (derivatives 26 and 27)
exhibited <0.001 µM IC50 values with good selectivity over other AGC
kinases (88).
Oltipraz belonging to a novel class of 1,2-dithiole-3-thiones were developed as
S6K1 inhibitors by Sang Geon Kim’s research group (89). Oltipraz inhibition of
S6K1 was in conjunction with a H2O2 scavenging effect that resulted in HIF-1α
activity inhibition and HIF-1α dependent tumor growth (90). The cancer therapeutic potential of oltipraz was explored extensively in in-vivo studies where oltipraz was found to induce diverse phase 2 enzymes, thereby decreasing the formation
of carcinogen-DNA adducts (91). Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials indicated beneficial
effects of oltipraz having diverse pharmacologic effects including reduced tumor
growth (92). A series of thiophene urea derivatives that were initially identified as
p39 inhibitors with an off-target activity against S6K1 were subjected to structure
optimization studies that led to the development of a potent S6K1 inhibitor
(IC50 = 0.015 µM) with excellent selectivity for S6K1 over 43 other kinases (93).
Pharmacokinetic studies on thiophene urea derivatives indicated only moderate
bioavailability and microsomal stability (94).
Derivatives of isoindoline-1,3-diones have been patented as S6K1inhibitors by
Sridhar research lab (95). Derivatives of the isoindoline-1,3-dione series exhibited
specific inhibition of S6K1 (IC50 values of 1–5 µM), WEE1, and PLK3 kinases

RPS6K1 for Refractory Breast Cancer

from a panel of 120 kinases. These compounds inhibited growth of multiple
breast cancer cell lines that were ER+, HER2+ and triple-negative. Derivatives of
indazoles have been patented by Sanofi-Aventis (96) as S6K1 inhibitors. Specificity
and potency information for the indazole derivatives are not yet available. The
search for natural products that are S6K1 inhibitors have resulted in the identification of rosmarinic acid methyl ester (RAME) (97) and gingerenone A (Gin A)
(98) as S6K1 inhibitors with therapeutic potential for cancer and insulin resistance. RAME fully inhibited S6K1 activity at a concentration of 80 µM. RAME was
also shown to induce autophagy and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells (97). Gin A
was found to decrease S6 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner and overcomes insulin resistance and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in
3T3-L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes (98). Organometallics complexes based on
the core structure of staurosporine were developed as S6K1 inhibitors (99). The
best complex, FL772, inhibited S6K1 (IC50 = 0.0073 µM) with >65% inhibition
of 26 out of 456 kinases. FL772 was only able to inhibit S6 phosphorylation in
budding yeast but not in 293T and BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cells.

CONCLUSION
Over the past two decades, enormous insight has been obtained on the role of
S6K1 as regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Targeting S6K1 for therapeutic
intervention in resistant and refractory breast cancer is promising. Several
­pharmaceutical companies and research groups have begun exploring the use of
ATP-competitive inhibitors of S6K1 in treatment of cancers. Further studies are
still needed to understand the overall function of S6K1 in different types of breast
cancer to achieve complete success as therapeutics.

ERα. ERα can also be activated via the phosphorylation induced by growth f­ actors.
Activated ERα functions as a transcriptional regulator with a pro-tumor activity

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) is a serious health problem and the leading cause of death in
women worldwide (1–3). Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα) is a nuclear receptor
expressed in more than 70% of BC cases (1–4). ERα is localized and functions in
the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, and the subcellular distribution
of this receptor is highly regulated by several factors (5) (Figure 1). In the nucleus,
ERα is a transcription factor that induces the expression of estradiol-dependent
genes. In BC cells, ERα expression has been related to the upregulation of estradiol-target genes that are associated with mammary tumor development (6–8).
ERα also acts as a transcriptional regulator for other transcription factors, including AP1, NF- κB, and Sp1, to modulate gene expression (6, 7). ERα can also be
localized outside the nucleus, and activate the signaling pathways that contribute
to BC progression and endocrine resistance (8, 9). Hence, ERα associates with
diverse transmembrane receptors and cytoplasmic proteins to activate its extranuclear signaling pathways (10, 11). Moreover, ERα can be directly localized at
the plasma membrane via palmitoylation to activate the signaling that influences
gene expression (12, 13).
ERα contains four main domains: the activation function domain-1 (AF-1),
the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the ligand-binding domain (LBD), and the activation function domain-2 (AF-2) (Figure 2). The canonical signaling pathway of
estrogen hormones, such as estradiol, is initiated when the hormones are recognized by LBD (14, 15). Enhancer and promoter regions of the estradiol-target
genes contain specific palindromic sequences named ERE (estrogen response elements), which bind the DBD of ERα to regulate gene expression. AF-2 recruits
coregulators in the presence of E2 hormone, whereas AF-1 recruits coregulators
in its absence (16–19). Furthermore, AF-1 can be modulated by phosphorylation
(e.g., S118, S167) in response to growth factors (16–22). The recruitment of ERα
to the enhancer and promoter sequences is also supported by pioneer factors
(e.g., FOXA1 and GATA3) in BC cells (23, 24). Several studies have shown that
ERα recruits coregulators, including coactivator and corepressor complexes. In
BC, there is an increase in the levels of coactivators for ERα that open the chromatin to promote gene expression (25–29).
The targeted drug therapy for ERα+ BC is based on endocrine therapies that
include aromatase inhibitors (AIs), selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs),
and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The AIs inhibit estradiol

Figure 1. Signaling of ERα in breast cancer cells. ERα exhibit multiple localizations including
the nucleus, cytoplasm, and membranes. In the cytoplasm, it is associated with cytoplasmic
proteins, and in the membrane through palmitoylation or transmembrane receptors (e.g.,
HER2). Estradiol (E2) activates ERα, promoting its accumulation in the nucleus, where the ERα
regulates the expression of E2-target genes. E2 and growth factors (EGF and IGF) can induce
ERα phosphorylation and promote its transcriptional activity. Fulvestrant and tamoxifen are
anti-estrogens that bind to ERα to mediate either its degradation or the repression of its
target genes, respectively.

Figure 2. ERα structure. ERα contains two activation-function domains (AF-1 and AF-2) that
interact with coregulators, some specialized sequences (NLS, nuclear localization signal, and
two NES, nuclear export sequence) necessary for nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of ERα. ERα is
a target for post-translational modifications (PTMs), including palmitoylation (Palm) and
phosphorylation (P). ERα phosphorylation at sites S104, S106, S118, and S167, is promoted by
E2 and growth factors (GF). K302 and K303 are involved in monoubiquitination and
polyubiquitination induced by E2 or fulvestrant.

production, whereas SERMs act as antagonists for ERα and induce the recruitment of corepressors, thereby inhibiting the expression of estradiol-target genes
(30–32). However, endocrine resistance, de novo or acquired, is displayed mainly
for SERMs owing to mechanisms that are not completely understood (9, 31–34).
In this context, SERDs appear to be more promising for BC treatment, as is
­discussed later.

ESR1 MUTATIONS IN BREAST CANCER
Several mutations, including Y537S, Y537N, Y537C, D538G, and E380Q, have
been detected in ESR1 gene that encodes for ERα, in both DNA from biopsies and
circulating tumor DNA obtained from patients with metastatic BC, and with
acquired resistance to AIs and SERMs (35, 36). These mutations are located in
LBD of ERα, and are related to changes in ERα conformation that promote its
estradiol-independent activity (37). Moreover, it has been reported that the gene
signature modulated by ERα wild type and its mutants differ, having few common
target genes. The ERα mutants can differentially interact with DNA and other
proteins and modulate gene transcription, indicating their molecular complexity
(36, 38–40). Moreover, in the induction of acquired endocrine resistance (by
long-term E2 deprivation) in BC cells, ESR1 mutations (Y537C and Y537S) are
detected (39, 41).

ERα STABILITY AS A MECHANISM THAT PROMOTES
PRO-TUMOR ACTIONS AND ENDOCRINE RESISTANCE
ERα is a target for polyubiquitination induced by estradiol, whereas its monoubiquitination is inhibited by estradiol (42). The polyubiquitination of ERα serves
as a signal for its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS); ­however,
ERα monoubiquitination seems to confer receptor stability, and modulates its
activity (43–45). Furthermore, both modifications are deregulated in mammary
tumors. In fact, it has been reported that some proteins interact with ERα to inhibit
their polyubiquitination and degradation via UPS. These ERα-polyubiquitination
inhibitor proteins (EPIPs) can act by several mechanisms l­eading to this receptor
stability in BC (Table 1) (46–64). The mechanisms that lead to the stabilization of
ERα include its phosphorylation by specific kinases, association with transcription regulators, and regulation by E3-ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases
(DUBs) (Figure 3). In recent years, new EPIPs have been discovered, demonstrating the relevance of ERα stability in pro-tumor molecular mechanisms associated
with BC progression and endocrine resistance. Interestingly, several E3-ubiquitin
ligases inhibit ERα degradation: RNF8, RNF31, and SHARPIN by inducing its
monoubiquitination (47–49), whereas Smurf1, TRIM56, and HOIL-1 by inhibiting its K48-specific polyubiquitination (50, 51). In addition, RNF181 stabilizes
ERα, inducing its K63-linked ubiquitination in BC cells (52).
Furthermore, some DUB proteins also confer stability to ERα. Nearly 100
DUBs have been identified in humans, and are classified into six families: USPs,

OTUs, UCHs, MJDs, MINDYs, and JAMMs (65). The DUBs implicated in ERα
stability are ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs: USP7, USP15, and USP35), and
one ovarian tumor protease (OTU: OTUD7B). In general, the proteins that stabilize ERα are upregulated in patients with mammary tumors, revealing their importance in the progression of this cancer (66). Thus, these results demonstrate the
importance of understanding the mechanisms of ubiquitination (mono-and polyubiquitination) and de-ubiquitination in the regulation of ERα stability in BC.

SERDS and PROTACs
Fulvestrant is a SERD that induces ERα polyubiquitination and degradation via
the UPS (32–34). There is a complete reduction in ERα levels in BC cells after 1 h
of treatment with fulvestrant (30, 67–69). Fulvestrant has been also approved as
the first-line endocrine therapy in BC and also in endocrine resistance to SERMs
or AIs (70). Interestingly, endocrine resistance to SERDs, such as fulvestrant and

Figure 3. Modulators of ERα stability in breast cancer cells. EPIPs (ERα polyubiquitination
inhibitor proteins) have been reported to inhibit ERα polyubiquitination in breast cancer
cells. These proteins protect ERα from degradation via the UPS. Diverse PTMs confer stability
to ERα: Monoubiquitination (produced by E3 ubiquitin ligases), the inhibition of K-48 linked
polyubiquitination, and deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes, which cut off polyubiquitination
tails of ERα.

AZD9496, has not been reported for the majority of ESR1 mutations (36, 39, 40).
New SERDs that are being studied are AZD9496, bazedoxifene, RAD1901,
GDC-0810, ZB716, and LSZ102. As fulvestrant exhibits poor bioavailability with
­intramuscular administration, the challenge is to develop a new generation of
SERDs that can be orally administered and with better bioavailability (71–76).
Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology works by inducing
the degradation of specific proteins. This activity is due to the bifunctional structure of PROTACs: one part of these molecules has a ligand for a targeted protein,
while the other part has the ability to recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby
­stimulating the targeted protein degradation via the UPS. Hence, PROTACs have
emerged as a promising alternative to control the pro-tumor effect of ERα by causing its downregulation via UPS (77, 78).

PROTAC technology
PROTACs are bimodular chimeras: they contain a binding module for the target
protein and another E3 ligase recognition module; a spacer or linker sequence
links these two modules (Figure 4). The PROTAC binds to its target protein,
­carrying a signal for its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (79). A polyubiquitinated protein is recognized by the 26S proteasome, transported to the 20S
core particle, and converted into oligopeptides by a variety of enzymes that

­ romote their release from the proteasome; this is followed by the recycling of
p
ubiquitin (80, 81).
Since 2001, the technology based on PROTACs is being developed by utilizing
heterobifunctional molecules (82). The first ligands for recruiting E3-ubiquitin
ligases in PROTAC technology were large peptides; however, they had the disadvantage of having a low level of cellular penetration owing to their size (81).
PROTAC technology was developed for the first time using a chimera containing
ovalicin in one domain and the phosphopeptide IκB in another domain. Thus,
this chimera had the ability to bind to methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2)
(by ovalicin) and to recruit the SCFβ-TrCP E3-ubiquitin ligase complex (by phosphopeptide IκB), thereby promoting its degradation via the proteasome (81, 82).
Later, other PROTACs were developed using the following E3 ubiquitin ligases:
MDM2 (murine double minute 2), CRBN (cereblon), VHL (von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor), and IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) (81, 83). PROTACs
based on IAPs have antitumor functions; however, special care must be taken
while designing them to avoid collateral effects (80, 84).
PROTACs display some disadvantages, for instance, they are generally large
molecules, and their pharmacokinetic characteristics are compromised, such as
bioavailability and solubility. In addition, the routes of administration of these
chimeric degraders are generally intraperitoneal or subcutaneous. However, in
recent years, the intravenous and oral routes are also being evaluated (79, 85, 86).

NOVEL PROTAC TECHNOLOGY FOR BREAST CANCER
TREATMENT
Several PROTACs have been developed for ERα, including, SNIPER(ER)-3,
PROTAC-B, PROTAC-2, compound 11, compound 24, lipophilic amino acid
Boc-Trp motif, C3-linked adamantane motif, monocyclic trifluoromethyl cyclohexane motif, and ERD-148 (87). PROTACs exhibit antitumor activity and the
ability to degrade ERα through the UPS in breast cancer cells (88). To date there
are some limitations in the cell-penetrating and target protein degradation ability
of the PROTACs designed for ERα; however, compound I-6 (a peptide-based
PROTAC) contributes to cell membrane penetration. As a result, this compound
can induce degradation of intracellular ERα and inhibit the ERα-dependent tumor
cell proliferation and growth in in vivo studies, thereby supporting its potential
use in breast cancer therapy (84).
Another molecule proposed for ERα + breast cancer based on PROTAC technology is PROTAC-2. This compound consists of estradiol that is covalently
bound to the phosphopeptide of IκBα containing an E3 recognition domain, and
thus recruits SCFβ-trcp, which leads to ERα ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The disadvantage of this PROTAC is that the IκBα
peptide is susceptible to phosphatases (89). Another traditional example is
PROTAC-B, which contains a pentapeptide derived from HIF-1α (hypoxia-­
inducible factor-1α) to be recognized by the E3-ubiquitin ligase, VHL (88, 90).
Similarly, E2-octa contains a synthetic octapeptide derived from HIF-1α, which is
very ­efficient in the degradation of ERα in human BC cells. Modifications of this
PROTAC gave rise to E2-penta, which produces a reduction in ERα levels (91). It
was only after 2011, when E3-ubiquitin ligase ligands were discovered, that major
progress was made in the development of next-generation PROTACs. The speciﬁc
and non-genetic IAP-dependent protein eraser (SNIPER), composed of a derivative of estradiol and a bestatin amide (a cIAP1 ligand), also showed a decrease in
ERα levels (81, 92).
A peptide-based PROTAC design has been shown to degrade ERα through the
binding of an ERα modulator peptide (TD-PERM; N-terminal aspartic acid
­cross-linked stabilized peptide ERα modulator) with a pentapeptide that binds to
the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (77). This heterobifunctional peptide has
the ability to recruit ERα and bring it to the VHL E3 ligase complex for degradation through the proteasome. Thus, this PROTAC (TD-PROTAC) induces the
­degradation of ERα, reduces the transcription of its target genes such as pS2, and
inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. The T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer
cells that express ERα showed early apoptosis when subjected to high doses of
TD-PROTAC (77).
Additionally, in a xenograft model of nude mice that received MCF-7 cells, the
administration of TD-PROTAC promoted tumor regression (77). ARV-471 is
another PROTAC for ERα that is well tolerated and is currently in phase 2 clinical
trials. It functions by reducing the ERα levels, and ERα variants such as Y537S
and D538G (80). ERD-308 is another PROTAC that displays a better ERα degradation capacity, as well as a greater cell proliferation inhibitory capacity than
­fulvestrant (83).

PROTACs for Estrogen Receptor Alpha in Breast Cancer

DISCUSSION
ERα stability is increased in BC cells, and it has been associated with tumor
­progression and the development of endocrine resistance (93). New studies are
emerging, which are demonstrating that many proteins are involved in ERα
­stability in BC, which emphasizes the pro-tumor potential of Erα, and endocrine
resistance (Table 1 and Figure 1). Therefore, the mechanisms that control ERα
stability may be targeted for the development of new drugs and also the improvement of current therapies. Thereby, SERDs and PROTACs are critical therapeutic
strategies for controlling breast cancer progression. Even though new SERDs are
being developed, only fulvestrant has been approved thus far (32). To avoid the
­development of resistance to SERD treatments based on ERα degradation, it is
important to consider the implications of ERα stability-associated pathways.
Interestingly, although PROTACs show good promise for BC due to their abilities
for causing ERα ubiquitination and degradation, the mechanisms that lead to ERα
stability may also represent a limitation. This is because several USPs participate
in the inhibition of polyubiquitination and degradation of ERα, and many of them
are upregulated in mammary tumors. Moreover, although some E3-ubiquitin
ligases can promote ERα degradation via polyubiquitination, there are others that
can inhibit the degradation of this receptor by inducing its monoubiquitination
(Table 1). Thus, ERα stability may also have an impact on the therapies based
on the degradation of this receptor in BC cells. There is a growing need for the
development of new SERDS-like molecules and PROTACs that can induce ERα
degradation in BC, which can block tumor progression. Attention should be paid
to the improvement of bioavailability and administration routes of SERDs and
PROTACs, as well as the denominated SERD-like PROTACs (78).
PROTAC technology is a promising system that is starting to be used in patients
with BC, as well as in patients with other types of cancer (80, 89). This technology
shows that when suitable ligands are used to target Erα, they can promote its
degradation almost entirely, and therefore, nullify its transcriptional activity and
signaling, and promote the death of BC cells both in vitro and in vivo (77).
Currently, some PROTACs are already in the clinical stage (80), and it is expected
that they will exhibit high specificity when administered orally, with good stability
and cell permeability. Thus, the PROTAC system is currently being evaluated in
clinical trials conducted in patients with metastatic BC, with the interest of some
pharmaceutical companies (81). At present, PROTACs are not intended to replace
traditional cancer therapies, but rather, be included as co-adjuvants in such treatments. This technology could complement current cancer therapy strategies. The
next step in PROTACs technology would be to improve their pharmacokinetic
properties for a wider clinical application and consider the implications of the
mechanisms that stabilize ERα in BC.

CONCLUSION
Several studies have suggested the existence of a wide range of proteins that c­ onfer
ERα stability in BC, which is related to tumor progression and endocrine r­ esistance.
Under these conditions, the development of treatments focused on the induction

of ERα degradation is required. Both SERDs and PROTACs have the ability to
downregulate ERα via degradation through the UPS with the aim of reducing its
pro-tumor effects. However, further studies are required to improve these drugs
for use in the treatment of BC, and also to evaluate the role of ERα stability in
these treatments.

Abstract: While patient-specific targeting of cellular growth and viability pathways
dominates current approaches in anti-cancer therapeutics development, appreciation for the strategy of targeting transformation-dependent alterations in cellular
organelle structure and function continues to grow. Here we discuss the lysosome
as an anti-cancer target, highlighting its role as a key mediator of cell death. As the
major degradative compartment of the cell, the lysosome houses dozens of
­destructive enzymes and is responsible for the breakdown of both ­internal and
external molecules and particles; however, until relatively recently the contribution of the lysosome to cellular death mechanisms has been largely overlooked.

Renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of lysosomal rupture to combat cancer has led to development of lysosome-disrupting agents that induce lysosomal
membrane permeabilization (LMP), cathepsin protease release, and subsequent
lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD), now distinguished as a bona fide cell
death process. Here, we present the basic biology, structure, and function of the
lysosome, with particular emphasis on the transformation-associated alterations
that sensitize cancer cell lysosomes to membrane rupture. We further describe the
lysosome’s role in cell death and comprehensively outline emerging therapeutic
strategies that exploit lysosomes for the treatment of a variety of malignancies.

INTRODUCTION
Using subcellular fractionation based purely on biochemical criteria, de Duve and
colleagues (1955) made the serendipitous discovery of the lysosome (1, 2), an
achievement deemed worthy of the Nobel Prize in Physiology (1974). Upon
observation that liver-derived acid phosphatase exhibited latent activity following
homogenization, it was deduced that a membrane-bound structure must n
­ ormally
sequester it, and potentially other degradative hydrolases, from their
­substrates (2, 3). Indeed, the lysosome harbors some 60 lytic enzymes (4) capable
of degrading proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, and lipids. Subsequent
investigations determined that lysosomes serve as the terminal compartment for
the degradation of extracellular materials taken up by endocytosis and phagocytosis and the d
­ igestion of intracellular constituents isolated during autophagy (5, 6).
We now appreciate that lysosomes are more than cellular refuse depots; they are
fundamental components of dynamic physiologic processes such as plasma membrane repair, bone and tissue remodeling, matrix degradation, inflammatory
responses, antigen presentation, cholesterol homeostasis, nutrient sensing and
metabolism, cell ­signaling, growth factor recycling, and programmed cell death
(7–23). These p
­ rocesses differentially rely on fusion with endocytic vesicles or the
regulated release of lysosomal hydrolases into the cytosol via lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP) or into the extracellular space via lysosomal exocytosis. A
summary of the lysosome’s various functions is illustrated in Figure 1.
Of note are observations that the quantity, composition, and complement of
lysosomal hydrolases are often augmented with cancer pathologies. Along these
lines, lysosomal heparanase and cathepsins promote cancer cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and metastasis, suggesting that these and other lysosomal enzymes
are of potential clinical significance (24, 25). The therapeutic implications of lysosomal hydrolases were recognized decades ago, with seminal investigations
describing enhanced activities of lysosomal enzymes in solid tumors as compared
to their tissues of origin, with specific enzymes (i.e., beta-glucuronidase) favoring
tumor cell invasiveness (26). Perhaps it is not surprising then that cancer cells
often exhibit an expansion of the lysosomal compartment (24, 27, 28), a feature
that would enhance tumor aggressiveness. However, such distinction may also
provide a rational basis for therapeutic intervention. Cancer-associated lysosomes

are more fragile than their normal counterparts due in some measure to increases
in hydrolytic enzymes and fundamental changes in the composition of the lysosomal membrane (29–31). Based on the concept that the lysosome may represent
a ‘suicide-bag’ as first proposed by de Duve (32), the instability of cancer-­associated
lysosomes may lend to enhanced cellular susceptibility to LMP, coincident release
of destructive hydrolases into the cytosol and ultimate cell demise by either apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms.
Herein, we review the fundamentals of lysosome physiology, composition, and
function in cell death, and connect cancer-associated changes in the expression
and activity of lysosomal components with a particular focus on the therapeutic
opportunities they may provide for breast and other tumor types.

LYSOSOMAL STRUCTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND
IDENTIFICATION
Lysosomes are typically less than 1 μm in diameter and contribute up to 0.5% of
the total intracellular volume of many eukaryotic cells, although this may vary
depending upon cell type (i.e., macrophages), energetic state, or degradative
requirements (33–35). Unlike other organelles, lysosomes cannot be identified
based on uniform morphologic criteria, as there is significant variation in their
size, architecture, and morphology depending upon nutrient availability, for
example, autophagy (36–39). Significant augmentation of lysosome volume,
abundance, and structure also occurs during certain pathologic states, for example, lysosomal storage diseases (40) and cancer (24, 41), or following experimental manipulations that inhibit enzymatic digestion such as overloading with
non-physiologic substrates such as sucrose (42), administration of cationic
amphiphilic drugs (CADs (43–45)), or treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics
(46). Interestingly, lysosomes at peripheral locations can partially change their
intracellular pH (47, 48), a feature that may be co-opted by some cancer cells to
facilitate constitutive mTOR signaling (38) or modulate extracellular acidity to
enhance invasion (49, 50).
By electron microscopy, lysosomes are identifiable as either tubular or spherical membrane-bound structures with cores of variable densities, amorphous granular material, or membrane whorls (34, 51). Biochemically, lysosomes are defined
by the presence of multiple hydrolytic enzymes (32) which may vary between
tissue type (51) and pathology (25, 40). Lysosomes may be distinguished from
endosomes by their pH, calcium content, abundance of lysosomal-associated
membrane proteins LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, and lack of mannose-6-phosphate
receptors (34, 52–54). Fluorescent dyes that accumulate in acidic vesicles––such
as LysoTracker Red and Acridine Orange––effectively label lysosomes, however
other acidic vesicles such as endosomes and autophagosomes may be concomitantly labeled to varying degrees (55).

LYSOSOME COMPOSITION
Lysosomes can degrade a vast array of structurally diverse macromolecules into
their constituent components. Following degradation, substances either diffuse or
are transported out of the lysosome into the cytosol where they become fuel for
metabolism or substrates for biosynthetic pathways (5). This dynamic recycling
process requires the coordinated action of the lysosomal acid hydrolases with
integral, peripheral, and transiently-associated proteins as discussed in the following sections.

Lysosomal hydrolases
To achieve efficient breakdown of complex substrates, lysosomes contain several
acid hydrolases such as proteases, glycosidases, nucleases, sulfatases, and lipases.
In addition to the degradation of material delivered via endosomes, phagocytic

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

vesicles, and autophagosomes, lysosomal hydrolases are involved in diverse processes such as pro-protein and antigen processing, degradation of extracellular
matrix, stimulation of angiogenesis, and the initiation of cell death (13, 56–61).
Chief among the acid hydrolases are the aspartic, serine, and cysteine proteases, with the most widely studied being the cathepsins (62). While cathepsins are
most recognized for their activity within the lysosomal compartment, a number of
studies have indicated their localization to any vesicle along the endocytic pathway (early and late endosomes, phagosomes), within the nucleus or cytosol, at the
cell surface, or secreted into the extracellular matrix, depending on physiologic or
pathologic state (61–64). Cathepsins are synthesized as inactive precursors that
are then processed to their mature and active form by proteolytic removal of the
N-terminal propeptide (65). Removal of the propeptide may occur by autolysis
within acidic lysosomes or by activation of other proteases in a chain-like reaction
(66–70) and may be enhanced in the presence of glycosaminoglycans or polysaccharides (71–74). While most cathepsins become destabilized at neutral pH,
several interacting partners such as heparin and catalase may prolong cathepsin
activity by promoting structural integrity and inhibiting peroxidation (75, 76).
Originally considered to function only within the lysosome in general protein
turnover, it has become exceedingly clear from gene knockout models that cathepsins have non-redundant and diverse functions and may be expressed ubiquitously in a tissue-specific or even context-specific manner (77–82). The diversity
of this class of proteases is beyond the scope of this review and has been extensively examined elsewhere (63, 83–85). Notably, cysteine proteases B, L, S, X,
and K, as well as aspartic cathepsin D, have all been implicated to varying degrees
in cancer progression. Along these lines, cathepsins in cancer cells are often translocated to the plasma membrane along with pH regulators such as v-ATPases and
Na+/H+ exchangers (86), where they associate with microdomains or are secreted
in an active form (87). In this respect, cancer cells effectively exploit cathepsins to
remodel the extracellular environment to potentiate invasion and metastasis
(61, 88–93). Alternatively, infiltrating macrophages may supply cathepsins to
stimulate angiogenesis and promote the growth and invasion of associated tumor
cells (94).
Cathepsins may be specifically regulated by interactions with endogenous
inhibitors, including cytosolic stefins, extracellular cystatins, and kininogens
(63, 93). As such, blunted cystatin often accompanies enhanced cathepsin levels
during the acquisition of invasive capacity (95). More recently, cathepsins have
been implicated in the development of intrinsic therapeutic resistance and adaptive responses to treatment (93, 96–98).

Membrane-associated proteins and lipids
The lysosomal membrane contains more than one hundred proteins, with LAMP-1
and -2 comprising nearly 50% of the total protein content (99). The oligosaccharide side chains on LAMPs and LIMPs (lysosomal integral membrane proteins)
form a thick polysaccharide coat, or glycocalyx, that lines the inner surface of the
lysosomal membrane to ensure protection of sensitive lysosomal and extralysosomal substrates from degradative hydrolases (100, 101). In addition to ensuring
compartmentalization of acid hydrolases and maintaining structural integrity,

199

200

Berg AL et al.

peripheral and integral membrane-associated proteins are vital to lysosomal
(LAMP-1) and the plasma membrane (RABs and SNAREs) trafficking, transport of
ions and soluble substrates (cation channel mucolipin1, chloride channel CLCN7,
protein transporter LAMP-2A, amino acid transporter LAAT1), and nutrient
­sensing (v-ATPase), as previously reviewed (52, 102–106). In addition, lysosomes
may contain multiple internal vesicles that harbor their own unique complement
of proteins and lipids (107, 108), imparting further functional diversity. Given
this diversity and the propensity for alterations during cancer, it is worth detailing
a few key membrane constituents. For a more in-depth discussion, the reader is
referred to several excellent topical reviews (108–113).
Several observations suggest that LAMPs may contribute to the fragility of
cancer-associated lysosomal membranes. Oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts
is accompanied by a decrease in LAMP expression, redistribution of lysosomes to
the cell periphery, and increased sensitivity to lysosomal cell death and to agents
that induce LMP (114). Conversely, LAMP overexpression was found to be protective against LMP (114), and a role for LAMP in cytoprotective autophagy has been
proposed (115). While overall LAMP expression is reportedly increased in a number of cancers (27, 116–118), it is likely these observations are indicative of an
increase in total lysosome content and not changes in their activity per se. Given
the role of LAMPs in the formation of the protective glycocalyx, it is conceivable
that their overall loss augments internal hydrolase-mediated damage to other
lysosomal membrane constituents and propensity toward LMP.
Lysosomes are bound by a single bilayer membrane, which is comprised of a
primary lipid matrix of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and ­cholesterol (110).
In general, glycerophospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylinositol dictate the fluidity of biomembranes and participate in trafficking, fission, and fusion events (110, 119). Lysosomal and late
endosomal membranes are uniquely enriched in the glycerophospholipid
bis(monoacylglycero) phosphate (BMP), permitting a heightened capacity for
cholesterol transport and sphingolipid degradation (108, 120, 121). Along these
lines, depletion of cellular cholesterol results in an increase in lysosomal density
and affects resistance to agents such as sucrose and lytic compounds known to
perturb membrane structure (122). Moreover, cholesterol contributes to the formation of detergent-resistant lipid rafts within lysosomal membranes, which are
focal centers for sorting and concentrating complexes of proteins vital for trafficking and signal transduction (123) as shown by proteomic (18) and biochemical
(124) analyses. Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a secreted
glycoprotein that promotes the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (125) and
inhibits cell growth (126), concentrates specifically at lipid rafts (18). Lipid rafts
have garnered particular interest in recent years because of their role in metastasis
and various cell death pathways (127).
Although originally considered a source of structural support, mounting
­evidence implicates sphingolipids like sphingomyelin, ceramide, and glycosphingolipids as important agents of lipid raft cell signaling cascades (110, 128, 129).
Different sphingolipid species have been implicated in regulating cell survival,
angiogenesis, inflammation, proliferation, autophagy, and programmed cell death
(130–133). For example, ceramide, which is hydrolyzed from sphingomyelin by
lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) (134) or other mechanisms (135, 136),
has been intensively studied following observations that aSMase-deficient mice

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

were resistant to cell death induction (137, 138). The aSMase/ceramide pathway
has since been identified as a central component of cellular response to various
stressors and chemotherapeutics (111, 135, 139–141), potentiation of redox
­signaling (142, 143), autophagy (144–148) and regulation of proteins involved in
programmed cell death (i.e., phospholipase A2 (149), cathepsin D (150, 151),
Jun-N-terminal kinases (152).

LYSOSOMES IN CELL DEATH
Cell death is classically defined by morphological criteria: apoptotic cells display
cellular shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, and condensation into apoptotic bodies
for clearance by phagocytosis; autophagy-dependent cell death involves cytoplasmic vacuolization and autophagosome formation, followed by lysosomal degradation; necrosis manifests as organelle swelling, plasma membrane breakdown, and
disintegration of cellular structures (153). However, investigations into the precise biochemical and functional underpinnings of cell death processes have
revealed distinct “regulated” cytotoxic programs and prompted a diversification of
nomenclature. Lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD), characterized by lysosomal destabilization and requiring LMP, is now distinguished as a subclass of
programmed cell death (153). Though lysosomal rupture has been observed as an
ultimate consequence of canonical cell death processes (154), primary LMP activates a death program in LDCD and can be differentiated by novel assay systems
(155, 156). LMP does not generate defining morphological alterations (157) and
is therefore classified at the molecular level by release of lysosomal luminal contents including proteolytic cathepsin enzymes to the cytosol, where cathepsins
function in a variety of contexts as cell death executioners (158). However, the
precise mechanisms leading to loss of lysosomal membrane integrity and protease
translocation to the cytosol are not fully elucidated for the majority of LMP
­stimulants. Activities of pore-forming toxins such as venoms, bacterial toxins, and
viral entry proteins are fairly straightforward; these compounds can disrupt membrane dynamics from within the lysosome following their uptake into the endolysosomal system and activation at low-pH, or alternatively induce pore formation
from the cytosol (158, 159). Lysosomotropic detergents are well-studied LMPpromoting agents that function by directly disrupting membrane dynamics leading to organelle leakage or by impairing function of lysosomal lipases (158).
Under physiological conditions, LDCD contributes to tissue remodeling during
mammary gland involution (160) and regulates immune cell clearance following
inflammation (161) or bacterial infection (162). Moreover, LDCD is associated
with a variety of pathological states (153).

Consequences of LMP
LMP may either initiate or amplify a cell death cascade, and it can trigger distinct
pathways depending on cellular context and the nature of lysosomal injury. The
molecular players and morphological outcomes of a given lethal subroutine featuring LMP can be classified as apoptotic or necrotic, and it is widely accepted
that the degree of lysosomal rupture––with respect to number of lysosomes

201

202

Berg AL et al.

impacted and extent of membrane damage––dictates the specificity of lysosomal
component release and downstream cellular responses (158). Extensive LMP
allows rapid release of lysosome contents to the cytosol and lethal cytoplasmic
acidification, resulting in rampant hydrolysis of cytoplasmic contents and cell
death by necrosis following plasma membrane breakdown. Conversely, the cytosolic translocation of select cathepsins with limited LMP initiates a regulated
­signaling cascade and death resembling apoptosis (163–165). Indeed, cathepsin
inhibition can revert the effects of limited LMP. Cathepsins were identified as
principal mediators of LMP-dependent cell death by studies demonstrating cell
viability rescue with pharmacological or genetic manipulation of cathepsins and
their endogenous inhibitors (158, 166). Moreover, partial LMP may trigger a cytoprotective lysophagy response and cell survival if the degree of damage is sufficiently limited (167, 168). Lysosomal stress sensors activate endolysosomal
damage-response mechanisms (163) whereby injured lysosomes are eliminated
and recycled before the cell is committed to die. A greater understanding of the
precise lysosomal membrane alterations leading to LMP is required to elucidate
consequent cell fate determinations.
LMP is most widely studied in relation to caspase-mediated apoptosis-like
death. Select cathepsins that remain functional at neutral pH, including cathepsins B, D, and L, can activate apoptotic effectors following limited release from
leaky lysosomes (166). Indeed, cathepsins are implicated in apoptotic cancer
cell death in a variety of tumor models (169). Apoptotic pathways triggered by
intrinsic factors such as DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and LMP
ultimately converge on mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and
subsequent release of pro-apoptotic factors to the cytosol (166, 170–172).
Mechanistic understanding of primary LMP in apoptosis was developed largely
from studies using the lysosomotropic agent Leu-Leu-methyl ester (LLOMe) (173)
and other apoptotic stimuli (153). Following their cytosolic release, cathepsins
can cleave Bid to generate a pro-apoptotic t-Bid fragment, thereby initiating
the common intrinsic apoptosis pathway that includes t-Bid activation of poreforming Bax and Bak proteins, MOMP, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and
activation of executioner caspases (163, 173). In fact, cathepsin inhibition reduced
Bid processing and alleviated LMP, rescuing cancer cell viability (174). Cathepsins
can play a variety of other roles in LMP-mediated apoptotic death involving
MOMP. Cathepsins amplify signaling upstream of MOMP via proteolytic Bax activation (165) or inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (175), and they have
been shown to cleave caspases directly (158) or degrade the caspase inhibitor
XIAP (176). Of note, Bax may directly permeabilize the lysosomal membrane to
initiate primary LMP (153, 177, 178). LMP has also been observed downstream
of MOMP as a consequence of apoptotic signaling pathways (179, 180). Reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production generated by MOMP induces lysosomal membrane lipid peroxidation and LMP to perpetuate apoptotic cell death (176), while
various caspases themselves play causal roles in secondary LMP (158). Under
certain conditions, cathepsins regulate apoptotic death independent of caspases,
such as by direct cleavage of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) (181) or in cells with
defective apoptotic machinery (182).
LMP-mediated cell death can alternatively take the form of necrosis in the
absence of caspase activation, whereby cathepsins serve as the principal cell death
executioner proteases (63). The caspase dependence of LDCD pathways may shift

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

depending on the cellular context or severity of cellular insult, as some lysosomotropic agents induce either apoptotic or necrotic cell death in a dose-dependent
manner or in various cell types (173). Increased levels of oxidative stress or ATP
depletion have been reported to promote a necrotic LDCD phenotype in several
studies (166, 171). Necrosis, long considered an accidental and irreparable consequence of extreme chemical or physical cell stress, is now understood to be a
highly regulated process with defined molecular drivers (183). Though cathepsin
substrates in non-apoptotic death are not well characterized (63, 158), it is proposed that extensive LMP unleashes widespread cathepsin proteolysis and rapid
breakdown of cellular structures, as cathepsin inhibition can mitigate necrotic
LDCD (184–187). LMP may be an early and activating event in response to lysosome disruptors such as H2O2 (154), though it is also observed as a late-stage
consequence of signaling in receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinase-dependent
necroptosis (154). Furthermore, lysosomal ROS generation has been implicated
in the execution of ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death involving irondependent ROS accumulation which displays necrotic morphology (153, 188).
Lysosomes degrade iron-containing proteins including ferritin during autophagy
and serve as major storage sites of chelatable iron within the cell. Overloaded iron
can catalyze Fenton reactions in redox cycling to produce ROS, which damage
lysosomal membranes and increase the cell’s susceptibility to LMP (164).
Lysosomal disruption is critical to activation of the nod-like receptor (NLR)dependent ‘inflammasome’ in pyroptosis, an inflammatory cell death pathway
observed in macrophages that culminates in cellular swelling, plasma membrane
rupture, and cytokine release. Pyroptosis is characterized by recruitment and activation of pro-inflammatory caspase-1 by the multimodular inflammasome platform and is mediated by gasdermins, which form plasma membrane pores to
drive lytic death (189, 190). Various crystals and chemical compounds induce
LMP-mediated pyroptosis, and LMP is reportedly critical to NLRP3 inflammasome function, though the precise molecular pathway linking LMP and lysosomal
content release with inflammasome activation is debated (191, 192). Inflammasome
activation was shown to potentiate tumor invasion and stimulate angiogenesis in
cases where suppressive immune cells were favorably recruited to the tumor site,
such as in the absence of IL-12 (193). The pro- and anti-tumor functions of
inflammasomes may thus be context-dependent, reflected by responses of NLRP3
that differ significantly depending on cell lineage (e.g., hematopoietic vs. structural epithelium) or phenotype (193).
Lysosomes serve a principal function in autophagy, an adaptive cellular stress
response that is normally cytoprotective but contributes to cell death in many
pathophysiological conditions including cancer (153). During autophagy, the cell
digests and recycles macromolecules and whole organelles by forming double
­membrane-bound autophagosomes that deliver engulfed material to l­ ysosomes (194).
Considering the requirement for functional lysosomes in autophagy execution, it is
perhaps unsurprising that lysosomal damage can prevent autophagosome fusion
and dysregulate autophagic flux, precipitating cell death (195, 196). Cell death is
commonly the consequence of experimental or pharmacological autophagy blockade, and targeting autophagic processes has emerged as a promising therapeutic
strategy for treatment of diseases including cancer (197, 198). For example, lysosome-disrupting chloroquine derivatives kill tumor cells by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and chemotherapy-induced autophagy and demonstrate

203

promise in clinical trials (199–201), while an aborted autophagic response following co-administration of lovastatin and farnesyl transferase inhibitor leads to nonapoptotic tumor cell death such that protein prenylation may be required for
complete autophagy (202). Similarly, LMP may occur after inhibition of autophagic
flux by a sophoridine analog, leading to apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells (203).
However, autophagy regulation is complex, and plays roles in cell survival, cell
death, and other cytotoxic processes in a number of developmental and disease
contexts (153, 204). In fact, LMP and cysteine cathepsin activity have been implicated in autophagy regulation and facilitate autophagy-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells (205–207). Indeed, numerous cell death mechanisms involve lysosome
dysfunction, but the molecular interactions underlying phenotypic consequences of
LMP remain largely uncharacterized.

LYSOSOMES IN CANCER
As cancer is broadly characterized by rapid cell proliferation and upregulated cell
survival mechanisms to combat cellular damage, many transformation-associated
changes at the level of the lysosome serve to protect the cell from LMP and LDCD.
Paradoxically, the opposite effect is also observed, where neoplastic cells can
­sacrifice lysosomal stability in order to increase their tumorigenic potential or
aggressiveness (24). Therefore, it is critical to understand the complex regulation
of LMP in cancer cells in order to pharmacologically hedge the balance towards
LDCD for therapeutic benefit.
Cancer cells rely on increased metabolism to sustain their rapid proliferation.
The lysosome serves as a key regulator in this process and helps satisfy the catabolic need for building blocks for growth and neoplastic anabolic drive. The outer
lysosomal membrane serves as a docking site for mTORC1, a signaling complex
regulated by available nutrients in the cytoplasm. mTORC1 signals the upregulation of lipid and protein biosynthesis, as well as the transcription of pro-­
tumorigenic and anti-apoptotic regulators of the cell cycle (102, 208). Loss of
several tumor suppressors including p53, PTEN, NF1 and TSC1/2 have been
shown to activate mTORC1 (209). Furthermore, the lysosome is responsible for
executing autophagy, one of the cell’s primary mechanisms of catabolism (210).
Several cancers have engaged mechanisms to constitutively activate autophagy,
such as in Ras-driven pancreatic cancers. This increased baseline level of autophagic flux allows for more rapid clearance of toxic metabolites that build up as a
consequence of increased metabolism (211–213). Therefore, inhibition of autophagy could potentiate induction of LMP in such tumors.
The high metabolic activity of cancer cells presents another weakness in lysosomal regulation. Swift protein turnover demanded by rapidly dividing cancer
cells leads to excessive intralysosomal accumulation of iron (214). Iron accretion
alone is sufficient to sensitize the lysosome to LMP; however, Fenton-type reactions with H2O2 can generate additional ROS and further destabilize lysosomal
membranes through lipid oxidation. Coupled with the well-documented increase
in ROS production in cancer cells and augmented cytoplasmic levels of cathepsins, lysosomal iron accumulation sensitizes tumor cells to LMP and LDCD (215).
Other transformation-associated alterations in cancer cell lysosomes include

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

increases in expression of lysosomal enzymes, changes in lysosomal morphology
and localization, and modifications in lysosome-associated proteins. Cathepsins
are highly expressed in cancer cells and are localized to the cell periphery in secretory lysosomes, where they can be secreted into the surrounding extracellular
environment through a mechanism similar to the lysosomal exocytosis that allows
the formation of invasive protrusions in C. elegans development (216). Once in
the extracellular space, they wreak havoc by cleaving a variety of adhesion proteins, degrading the basement membrane, and releasing sequestered growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), leading to neoplastic progression through invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis (41, 217, 218). Additionally, downregulation of a potent
regulator of pericellular cathepsin accumulation, M6PR, in a rat cell model of
hepatocellular carcinoma abrogates inhibition of pro-neoplastic cathepsin
­activity (219). High concentrations of cathepsins predict increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many tumor types such as breast cancer, lung and
colorectal carcinomas, and gliomas (220–223). However, increased levels of
­cytosolic cathepsins also sensitize the cell to LDCD (224). Increased lysosomal
cathepsin activity leads to decreased LAMP-1 and -2 levels in ERK-, ErbB2-, and
K-Ras-driven models of cancer, reducing lysosomal membrane stability and rendering the organelle susceptible to LMP (114). These cancer-associated vulnerabilities illuminate a potential therapeutic window to selectively target tumor cells.
As previously noted, lysosomes are alternatively localized within transformed
cells; the switch from a perinuclear position to the plasma membrane facilitates
secretion of toxic contents into the extracellular space, promoting extracellular
acidification and activation of secreted lysosomal hydrolases (41). Increased
expression of v-ATPase in metastatic tumor cells also contributes to extracellular
acidification (225). Additionally, cancer cells exhibit increased lysosomal size, a
phenomenon correlated with the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells (28).
Once again, these tumorigenic changes compromise lysosomal stability, sensitizing tumor cells to LMP (28). Problematically, some forms of cancer have developed mechanisms to overcome this increased sensitivity to LMP. Breast cancer
cells show elevated expression of Hsp70 (226), which has been shown to rescue
lysosomal membrane integrity by stabilizing intralysosomal aSMase interaction
with the critical lipase cofactor BMP (30, 215). Likewise, mammary-derived
growth inhibitor (MDGI), which contributes to maintenance of lysosomal integrity, is a marker of invasiveness in human glioblastoma patient-derived cells that
are resistant to chemoradiation. Silencing MDGI leads to alterations in lysosomal
membrane lipid composition through reduced trafficking of polyunsaturated fatty
acids into the lysosomes, leading to eventual LMP-dependent cell death (227).
Along these lines, targeting Hsp70 or other molecules critical to lysosome stability
and function could prove to be promising therapeutic strategies.
Localization of transport proteins to the lysosomal membrane in transformation
confers therapeutic resistance via active sequestration and inactivation of antineoplastics within the lysosomal lumen. Canonically, members of the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) family of transporters reside in the plasma membrane where they
expel cytoplasmic antineoplastics, but some cancers (e.g., leukemia, breast and
cervical cancers) exhibit lysosomal expression of transporters like P-glycoprotein
(P-gp or ABC1), leading to drug sequestration in the lysosome (228–230).
Inhibition of P-gp in cancer cells restores sensitivity to the sequestered drugs and

205

206

Berg AL et al.

hyper-sensitizes cells to chemotherapeutic death (228, 230). Overexpression of
ABCA3 correlates with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia patients, and
ABCA3 localizes to lysosomes in a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (231, 232).
The transport protein ATP7B, a copper transporter, is overexpressed in many cancers (233) and serves to sequester and exocytose platinum-based antineoplastics
(234, 235). Overall, the dynamic changes in cancer-associated lysosomes reveals a
wide range of possible therapeutic options for exploration (236).

MODULATION OF LMP AND ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL
Depletion of cancer cells via LMP is an attractive therapeutic strategy, holding
particular promise for combating apoptosis-resistant cancer cell populations
(237). Initial interest in this regard was sparked by realization of the degradative
potential of lysosomes (1), catalyzing the search for pharmacologic agents that
would destabilize the lysosomal membrane to kill cancer cells from the inside.
Cholesterol and hydrocortisone were identified as stabilizing agents (32), while
weakly basic amines with long hydrophobic tails disturbed membrane structure
and induced LMP (238–240). However, enthusiasm quickly waned upon recognition that lysosomes were a ubiquitous feature of nearly all cells (excluding erythrocytes (34)), and would not permit the distinction between normal and cancer
cells (32). Interest has since reignited following more recent studies that suggest
cancer-associated lysosomes express unique features (i.e., size, hydrolase content,
membrane fragility) that may make them suitable for targeting. Numerous lysosome-disrupting agents are currently under investigation or in clinical development for cancer and other indications (237, 241), though clinical data
demonstrating efficacy of these approaches is limited. This section outlines select
agents known to induce LMP, with a particular emphasis on their potential as anticancer therapeutics. General mechanisms of LMP induction are illustrated in
Figure 2.

Lysosomotropic Agents
Weakly basic amine compounds rapidly accumulate within lysosomal lumens and
are thus referred to as ‘lysosomotropic’ (242). Sequestration of amine-containing
agents occurs by a non-enzymatic and non-transporter mediated cation-trapping
mechanism, referred to as ‘lysosomal trapping’ (44, 243, 244), but may also occur
by endocytosis or facilitated transport (245). In particular, CADs and lysosomotropic detergents feature a hydrophobic ring structure and a hydrophilic side
chain with a charged cationic amine group that allow them to readily diffuse
across cellular membranes in their non-ionized state. However, exposure to the
acidic interior of the lysosome leads to protonation and entrapment (242). As
these agents accumulate within the lysosomal lumen, they interact with negatively
charged intra-lysosomal vesicles, displacing associated enzymes and lipid binding
proteins and inducing swelling and vacuolization due to an influx of water into
the lysosomal lumen (242). The appearance of lamellar bodies that occurs in
response to some CADs (43) signals the accumulation of lipids within the lysosome that may occur following the interaction of drugs with phospholipids (246)

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

Figure 2. Mechanisms of LMP induction. (A) The lysosomal membrane is expanded to show
detail. Carbohydrates on lysosomal associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) and lysosomal
integral membrane proteins (LIMPs) form the protective glycocalyx. Also, resident within
lysosomal membranes are ion channels and the vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) that maintains
the acidic interior of the lysosome. A number of hydrolases are found within the lysosomal
lumen. Dysregulation of these endogenous factors can contribute to LMP. (B) LMP-inducing
agents including many lysosomotropic detergents and cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs)
contain hydrophilic side chains with charged cationic amine groups, allowing them to
passively partition across cellular membranes in their non-ionized state. Within the acidic
lysosomal lumen, these agents become protonated and sequestered in a process termed
‘lysosomal trapping.’ (C) The degree of LMP often dictates the ensuing course of cell death
(apoptosis or necrosis). (D) Expansion of the lysosomal membrane to show details of lipid
constituents: the lysosomal membrane is composed of phospholipids, glycerophospholipids
such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), cholesterol, and sphingolipids such as
sphingomyelin and ceramide. Sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed to ceramide by acid
sphingomyelinase (aSMase). Positively charged amino acids on aSMase allow it to interact
with negatively charged head groups on lipids such as phosphatidylcholine or
phosphatidylserine. aSMase is displaced by agents that interfere with this binding domain.
(E) Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production stimulates lipid peroxidation
and LMP. Lysosomal membrane peroxidation is augmented by production of reactive
hydroxyl radicals generated through degradation of iron-containing molecules within the
lysosomal lumen in the presence of reducing agents.

or via inhibition of phospholipid metabolism (247, 248). The anti-tumor efficacy
of CADs, including FDA-approved anti-histamines (227), anti-depressants (249),
and anti-malarials (250), has been documented in both experimental and observational studies. The CAD 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA) showed
robust induction of necrotic cell death in breast cancer cells regardless of molecular profile, with little toxicity against untransformed cells (184). Another CAD,
the anti-histamine clemastine, killed patient-derived glioblastoma cells by LMP
but was minimally toxic in normal human astrocytes and murine brain endothelial cells, pointing to a critical therapeutic window for the treatment of this highly
aggressive and chemo-refractory disease (227). Lysosomotropic detergents, which
combine weakly basic amines (e.g., imidazole, morpholine) with long (9–14
­carbons) and straight hydrocarbon tails, are characterized by membrane disruptive surfactant properties that progress with continued lysosomal accumulation
(238–240). Derivatives of imidazole and morpholine lysosomotropic detergents
were originally developed as anticancer therapeutics, inducing apoptosis or
­necrosis with LMP in a dose-dependent fashion across a range of cancer cell types
(239, 251–253).
Interestingly, basic amines are a ubiquitous feature of therapeutic agents,
conferring varying degrees of lysosomotropic potential (254). As such, lysosomal
drug sequestration may either be cytotoxic or cytoprotective depending upon
whether it potentiates LMP or prohibits interactions with the intended target.
Indeed, substantial evidence supports the notion that the lysosome contributes to
chemotherapeutic resistance (255–258). In one such mechanism, cellular stress
resulting from accumulation of lysosomotropic drugs was shown to trigger exocytosis, leading to lysosome-mediated multidrug resistance (259). Furthermore, the
degree of resistance to the topoisomerase II inhibitor C-1330 and the receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib was directly associated with the total number
of lysosomes (258) and, perhaps more importantly, the degree to which the normal cytosol-to-lysosome pH gradient is altered within a given cancer cell (260).
Similar to other anti-cancer therapeutics (doxorubicin, mitoxantrone), C-1330
and sunitinib were shown to preferentially accumulate within lysosomes, triggering substantial, dose-dependent increases in lysosome number, size, and their
ability to uptake the lysosomal marker LysoTracker Red (258). Poor lysosomal
accumulation and retained drug sensitivity was associated with intrinsic disruption of the physiologic pH of some cancer cell lysosomes (i.e., MCF7 breast cancer
cells) (260). Accordingly, diminished lysosomal entrapment of weakly basic
amines could be replicated with pharmacological disruption of the pH gradient
following v-ATPase inhibition by bafilomycin A (255, 260) or administration of
the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (255), suggesting that modulation of
lysosomal pH may be an effective strategy to overcome chemoresistance.
Indeed, the pH-disrupting agents chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have
been investigated as anti-cancer therapeutics, with dozens of clinical trials in
progress (241, 261–265). Long used as an antimalarial, chloroquine sensitizes
cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Although thought to convey therapeutic sensitivity through the inhibition of protective autophagy, recent evidence
suggests its role may be more complicated (266–268), and may at least partially involve the capacity to overcome drug sequestration within lysosomes
(255, 269, 270). Nevertheless, as a nonspecific inhibitor of autophagy, potential
side effects may arise from a loss of protective autophagy within normal tissues

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

(i.e., brain, liver, heart, kidney) that occurs during therapeutic intervention (271).
Along these lines, chloroquine-treated mice are more likely to suffer from kidney
damage in a model of ischemic–reperfusion than untreated animals (272).
Chloroquine uptake may also be reduced in the external acidic milieu of some
tumors, reducing its efficacy under these conditions (273). However, particular
derivatives of chloroquine (273) or other small molecule inhibitors of autophagy
(264) may offer improved stability and potency and warrant further study.

Nanoparticles
While nanoparticles have been extensively investigated for efficient tumor-site
delivery of anti-cancer drugs in recent years, issues of non-specific cell toxicity
are often attributed to lysosome dysfunction, as nanoparticles can accumulate in
lysosomes and induce LDCD themselves. However, the precise mechanisms
underlying nanoparticle toxicity are debated, with the involvement of autophagy
in question in various cancers (274, 275). Several studies reported that early
induction of autophagy allowed rapid nanoparticle uptake and delivery to
­lysosomes—a requirement for zinc oxide nanoparticle (ZnONP)-mediated cytotoxicity, i.e., nanoparticle dissolution and content release within the lysosomal
lumen (276)––but that subsequent lysosomal damage resulting from nanoparticle
buildup impaired autophagic flux and ultimately resulted in cell death (276, 277).
Moreover, ZnONP cytotoxicity was not attributed to nanoparticle dissolution and
zinc ion release within lysosomes in cellular models of leukemia and normal red
blood cells but rather to LMP triggered by intact nanoparticles (278). A variety of
nanoparticle formulations are currently under investigation as novel lysosomedisrupting cancer therapeutics (279, 280). Interestingly, a recent report demonstrated that nanoparticles carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics
can become sequestered in lysosomes and exhibit inefficient endolysosomal
escape (281), while CAD administration promotes LMP and cytosolic siRNA
delivery.

Sphingolipids
Mounting evidence suggests that LMP occurs following specific changes in the
composition of membrane lipids and major lysosomal proteins (114). Particularly
interesting data has recently come to light suggesting that cancer cells have perturbed lipid species as compared to their normal counterparts, a feature that may
permit their selective depletion. Along these lines, the lysosomotropic detergent
siramesine and similar compounds directly induce LMP and non-apoptotic cell
death in transformed cells but not in oncogene-depleted (‘detransformed’) or
non-transformed variants (29, 282). These effects were universal across all cancer
types tested (breast, ovary, prostate, cervix and bone (29)). Intriguingly, similar
cancer specific effects were not found for other compounds that also induce LMP
(i.e., LLOMe, sphingosine) or neutralize pH (concanamycin A) (29), although the
lack of specificity may be related to the dose used (283).
Ostensibly, siramesine cytotoxicity is mediated by the displacement of aSMase
(29), normally responsible for the breakdown of sphingomyelin to ceramide at
the inner lysosomal membrane (134). Augmentation of aSMase activity occurs in

209

210

Berg AL et al.

stressed normal cells following induction of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), which
then binds the glycerophospholipid BMP to activate aSMase at the lysosomal
membrane (30). The constitutive elevation of Hsp70 has been detailed for a number of cancer types, and is associated with resistance to caspase-dependent
and -independent cell death and poor prognosis (284–287). Bolstered aSMase
activity appears to contribute to lysosomal integrity (29), making it a particularly
attractive therapeutic target. Accordingly, exposure to siramesine (29) or Hsp70
small molecule inhibitors (288) results in reductions in aSMase activity, induction
of LMP, caspase-independent cell death and enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. In agreement with siramesine-mediated aSMase inhibition, depleted
Hsp70 induces effects that are cancer cell specific (286, 289–292). It is likely that
aSMase inhibition perturbs lipid ratios (293), leading to membrane fragility and a
propensity for LMP (29). This postulate is further supported by studies suggesting
that augmented sphingomyelin content alone destabilizes lysosomal
­membranes (30), is selectively toxic to transformed cells (294), inhibits autophagic flux (295), and impairs intracellular vesicle and plasma membrane fusion
events (296). Destabilized lipid content following aSMase inhibition also affects
signaling events at the plasma membrane, including the clustering and signaling
of K-Ras (293), a protein with a dominant role in cell proliferation and survival.
These data suggest that aSMase inhibition may not only be cancer cell specific
(29), but may also be particularly well suited for K-Ras-driven cancers (i.e., pancreas, colon and lung), which currently lack targeted therapeutic options (297).
The clinical significance of sphingolipid species is further substantiated by
observations that perturbed ceramide clearance was directly correlated with
reduced chemotherapeutic sensitivity (298). As such, modification of ceramide
levels by enhancing de novo biosynthesis or modulating aSMase activity have
also been suggested as potential anti-cancer strategies to overcome imbalances in
lysosomal ceramide (298–301). Although a clear link has yet to be established, a
recent study demonstrated that markedly enhanced aSMase potentiates the accumulation of ceramide and triggers cathepsin B release via LMP upstream of apoptosis (176). Importantly, cathepsin B catalyzes the degradation of XIAP (X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis) (176), the upregulation of which has been associated with
therapeutic resistance and poor survival (302–304).
It is worthwhile to note that experimental modulation of aSMase activity
appears to produce seemingly contradictory results. On the one hand, the depletion of aSMase results in sphingolipid accumulation, ceramide depletion, LMP,
and non-apoptotic cell death (29), whereas on the other hand its overexpression
precipitates ceramide accumulation, LMP, and apoptosis (176). As such, it is likely
that lysosome integrity depends upon the precise balance of sphingolipid species.
Moreover, it is conceivable that there are factors modified under conditions of
aSMase depletion or overexpression that await further investigation. For example,
sphingosine accumulation inhibits cholesterol export (305), which may have
implications for signaling events at lysosome-associated lipid raft domains or
in membrane dynamics. Moreover, modifications to sphingosine or ceramide
may generate either sphingosine-1-phosphate or sphingosine, respectively.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate binds to G-coupled protein receptors to regulate
growth, survival and migration of cells, and is associated with malignant transformation (306). Sphingosine was shown to induce LMP and programmed cell
death (307–309), albeit nonspecifically (29). It was proposed that accumulated

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

sphingosine permeabilizes the membrane in a detergent-like fashion, resulting in
cell death (310). A potential mechanism is outlined in Figure 3 that discusses the
intricate balance of sphingolipids in LMP induction.

Calcium
Interestingly, sphingosine was also shown to affect calcium release from the lysosomal membrane (311). Although not often considered a major calcium storage
site, the reported calcium concentration of 500μM within the lysosomal
lumen (312) is comparable with that of the endoplasmic reticulum (313). In studies addressing the pathology of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a rare progressive disorder characterized by the accumulation of sphingolipid species and
cholesterol, sphingosine was shown to induce the specific release of calcium from
lysosomes and late endosomes but not release from other intracellular storage

Figure 3. Membrane stabilization and permeabilization is dependent on the balance of
sphingolipids in lysosomes. Negatively charged bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP; shown
in teal) is enriched in membranes of intraluminal lysosomal vesicles and provides docking
points for positively charged acid sphingomyelinase, acid ceramidase, and other co-factors
such as heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and saposins (SAP). Proper recruitment of these
enzymes facilitates lipid metabolism and membrane stabilization. Cationic amphiphilic drugs
(CADs) disrupt BMP-enzyme interactions, inhibiting lipid metabolism and resulting in
lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Figure created with BioRender.com.

sites (311). This rise in cytosolic calcium was dependent on interaction of sphingosine with lysosome and endosome calcium channels (two-pore channel 1) (311).
Lysosome-released calcium is vital for vesicle fusion and secretion, autophagy,
and lysosomal biogenesis (39, 314–316), as well as apoptosis-dependent
­phosphatidylserine externalization (317), an early recognition signal for engulfment by phagocytic cells (318, 319). Intriguingly, prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress results in pancreatic cancer cell death mediated by LMP and
accumulation of cytosolic calcium (320). General increases in intracellular calcium are also associated with the activation of cytosolic calpain proteases and
the initiation of LMP. Along these lines, μ-calpain is capable of permeabilizing the
membrane of isolated lysosomes (321). Further, activated calpain species were
shown to localize to the lysosomal membrane prior to cathepsin release
(186, 322, 323), whereas their pharmacological inhibition effectively abolishes
LMP (324).

Reactive oxygen species
Increased production of ROS (i.e., singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide)
­stimulates lipid peroxidation and destabilization of the lysosomal membrane
(325–327). Cell death depends on the degree of LMP, where minimal leakage of
cathepsins is nonlethal, reversible (328), and primarily impacts cell proliferation,
while moderate or high membrane destabilization respectively induce apoptosis
and necrosis (170). Peroxidation of the lysosomal membrane is likely mediated by
local production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Since iron-containing macromolecules are degraded within the lysosomal lumen in the presence of reducing
agents (i.e., glutathione, ascorbic acid and cysteine), there is a capacity to generate
reactive radicals with exposure to H2O2 (329). Accordingly, iron chelation is
protective against LMP whereas accumulation of iron-containing proteins or
iron complexes sensitizes lysosomes to membrane damage (330–336). Cancerassociated lysosomes may have a heightened propensity to accumulate iron, given
the enhanced turnover of iron-containing proteins that accompanies their rapid
proliferation (170). Consequently, cancer cells may be more sensitive to ROSinduced LMP (214). Iron has also been implicated in maintenance of the cancer
stem cell (CSC) state, and salinomycin selectively kills cancer stem cells by sequestering iron in lysosomes, leading to ROS-mediated LMP and ferroptotic cell
death (337). Unsurprisingly, aSMase was implicated in ferroptosis initiation
through a positive feedback loop of ROS production, further connecting key lysosomal enzymes to ferroptosis (338).
While iron-loading has not been vetted as an anti-cancer strategy, such an
approach may offer particular benefit to hypoxic regions of tumors where limited
ROS production might contribute to insensitivity to LMP (329). Iron loading of
hypoxic cells may sensitize them to ionizing radiation or other ROS-generating
agents. On the other hand, redox-active iron has been suggested as a mutagen,
contributing to persistent oxidative stress of DNA damage (339–341). Ironchelation also has important clinical applications, protecting normal tissues
from radiation damage during cancer treatment (342). An exception is CAD
iron-chelating compounds, as they remain trapped within lysosomes and lead to
iron-starvation and death (343, 344).

The Lysosome as an Anti-Cancer Target

CONCLUSION
The lysosome is clearly more than a cellular garbage disposal, contributing to
dynamic processes that are essential to both normal physiologic function and disease pathology. Cancer-associated changes in lysosomal structure and function
may bolster therapeutic resistance but may also be the gateway to cancer cells’
ultimate demise. Indeed, emerging data suggests the lysosome is potentially a powerful anti-cancer target, given specific alterations in cancer cells that are not seen in
non-transformed counterparts. Moreover, cancer cells frequently evade therapyinduced apoptosis due to intrinsic or acquired mutations in caspase-dependent
pathways; thus, utilization of LDCD and other caspase-independent cell death programs will be critical in the future development of cancer therapeutics. Nevertheless,
a number of questions still remain with respect to cancer-associated lysosome
­signaling, membrane dynamics, ion regulation, and the precise role of LMP in cell
death, which have limited the number of lysosome-targeted therapeutics transitioning from preclinical study to clinical development. The dual functionality of
cathepsin activation in cancer cell invasion and LDCD is a critical area requiring
further investigation, as cathepsins are important mediators of both pro-tumorigenic
and pro-death processes, depending on context. Substantial progress on these and
other fronts will likely be fueled by continued advances in methods for the detection and quantification of lysosome-associated events.

Harvey N. Mayrovitz, PhD
Editor

Dr. Harvey N. Mayrovitz did his PhD graduate
work at the University of Pennsylvania and
trained at Temple University School of Medicine
and the Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia and at
the Medical Faculty and Hospital in Rotterdam
and Delft University in the Netherlands. In 1998,
after serving as the Director of Cardiovascular
Research at the Miami Heart Research Institute
in Miami Beach Florida, he joined Nova Southeastern University in
Ft. Lauderdale Florida where he is now a professor of physiology
in the Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Allopathic Medicine in the
Department of Medical Education. His teaching areas include
cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology directed toward medical
and graduate health-science students. His current research areas
include cardiopulmonary, lymphedema, and mostly noninvasive
clinical and biophysical studies for diagnosis and therapy. He
has authored over 150 scientific publications in these and related
areas along with multiple book chapters. He continues his research
activities and student mentoring with the most current research
focused on developing ways to assess and better understand
processes associated with lymphedema detection, progression,
and its treatment. He is also actively investigating the potential of
various forms of electromagnetic energy to influence blood flow
and other physiological parameters.
