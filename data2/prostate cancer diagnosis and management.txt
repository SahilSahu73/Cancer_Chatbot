Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and
practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs,
preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to
apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make
decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their
families and carers or guardian.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be
applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in
the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their
duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of
opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a
way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable
health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing
NICE recommendations wherever possible.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

This guideline replaces CG175, DG17 and ESNM30.
This guideline is the basis of QS91.

Overview
This guideline covers the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer in secondary care,
including information on the best way to diagnose and identify different stages of the disease, and
how to manage adverse effects of treatment. It also includes recommendations on follow up in
primary care for people diagnosed with prostate cancer.
A table of NHS England interim treatment regimens gives possible alternative treatment options
for use during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce infection risk. This may affect decisions for
patients with prostate cancer. See the COVID-19 rapid guideline: delivery of systemic anticancer
treatments for more details.

Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals
• Commissioners and providers of prostate cancer services
• People with prostate cancer, their families and carers

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their
care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or
certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about prescribing medicines
(including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and
mental capacity), and safeguarding.

1.1 Information and decision support for people with

prostate cancer, their partners and carers
Information
1.1.1

For advice on communication and patient-centred care throughout the patient
journey, follow the recommendations in the NICE guidelines on improving
outcomes in urological cancers and improving supportive and palliative care for
adults with cancer. [2008]

1.1.2

Offer people with prostate cancer information tailored to their own needs. This
information should be given by a healthcare professional (for example, a
consultant or specialist nurse) and may be supported by written and visual
media. [2008]

1.1.3

Offer people with prostate cancer advice on how to get information and support
from websites, local and national cancer information services, and from cancer
support groups. [2008]

1.1.4

Choose or recommend information resources for people with prostate cancer
that are clear, reliable and up to date. Ask for feedback from people with
prostate cancer and their partners or carers to identify the highest quality
information resources. [2008]

Decision support
1.1.5

Find out the extent to which the person wishes to be involved in their decision
making, and ensure that they have sufficient information to do so. [2008]

1.1.6

Use an up-to-date decision aid in all urological cancer multidisciplinary teams
(MDTs). Healthcare professionals trained in its use should offer it to people with
localised prostate cancer when making treatment decisions. [2008]

1.1.7

Use nomograms together with people with prostate cancer to help:
• with decision making
• predict biopsy results
• predict pathological stage
• predict risk of treatment failure. [2008]

1.1.8

Explain the reliability, validity and limitations of any predictions made using
nomograms. [2008]

1.1.9

Discuss all relevant management options in this guideline with people with
prostate cancer and their partners or carers, even if they are not available
through their local services. [2008]

1.1.10

Tell people with prostate cancer:
• about treatment options and their risks and benefits in an objective, unbiased manner
and
• that there is limited evidence for some treatment options. [2014]

1.1.11

Ensure that mechanisms are in place so people with prostate cancer and their
primary care providers have access to specialist services throughout the course
of their disease. [2008]

1.1.12

Tell people with prostate cancer and their partners or carers about the effects of
prostate cancer and the treatment options on their:

• sexual function
• physical appearance
• continence
• other aspects of masculinity.
Support people and their partners or carers in making treatment decisions, taking into
account the effects on quality of life as well as survival. [2008]
1.1.13

Offer people with prostate cancer, and their partners or carers, the opportunity
to talk to a healthcare professional experienced in dealing with psychosexual
issues at any stage of the condition and its treatment. [2008]

1.2 Assessment and diagnosis
MRI and biopsy
1.2.1

Do not routinely offer multiparametric MRI to people with prostate cancer who
are not going to be able to have radical treatment. [2019]

1.2.2

Offer multiparametric MRI as the first-line investigation for people with
suspected clinically localised prostate cancer. Report the results using a 5-point
Likert scale. [2019]

1.2.3

Offer multiparametric MRI-influenced prostate biopsy to people whose Likert
score is 3 or more. [2019]

1.2.4

Consider omitting a prostate biopsy for people whose multiparametric MRI
Likert score is 1 or 2, but only after discussing the risks and benefits with the
person and reaching a shared decision (see box 1). If a person opts to have a
biopsy, offer systematic prostate biopsy. [2019]

There is more than 1 type of prostate biopsy. The most common approach is transrectal
ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy. The data in box 1 comes from the PROMIS and ProtecT studies,
which used TRUS. There is no equivalent data for other types of biopsy. The ranges given in box 1
reflect different definitions of clinically significant prostate cancer (UCL1 and UCL2; see PROMIS
publications).

Box 1 Factors to consider when discussing the options for people whose multiparametric MRI
Likert score is 1 or 2
Advantages of undergoing prostate biopsy
You may have prostate cancer that the MRI scan missed:
• between 11 and 28 out of 100 people with a low-risk MRI actually have clinically
significant cancer
• there are many effective treatments for clinically significant cancer, which work best for
disease that is caught early; this means that, if you actually do have clinically significant
cancer that the MRI missed, you will have a better chance of long-term survival if the
biopsy finds it.
Disadvantages of undergoing prostate biopsy
There is no guarantee that a prostate biopsy will find any disease that is there. Prostate
biopsies find less than half of the clinically significant prostate cancers that MRI scans miss.
You may be diagnosed with clinically insignificant prostate cancer. This is disease that is
unlikely to be life-threatening, but will need monitoring and may lead to treatment. Therefore,
if someone has prostate cancer that truly is clinically insignificant, it is better not to find it.
Between 18 and 23 out of 100 people with a low-risk MRI get a diagnosis of clinically
insignificant prostate cancer if they have a prostate biopsy.
The most common type of biopsy, transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS), has some rare but
important complications. The most serious is sepsis, which develops in a bit fewer than 1 out
of 100 people. Other serious complications, including acute urinary retention, severe
haematuria and severe rectal bleeding may need hospitalisation.
TRUS biopsy has fewer serious complications that make it unpleasant to undergo for some
people.
On average:
• 3 out of 100 people feel light-headed or dizzy immediately after the biopsy

• 44 out of 100 people report pain; in 15 of them, it will last for at least 2 weeks; 7 will
consider it a moderate or serious problem
• 20 out of 100 people develop a fever; in 3 of them, it will last for at least 2 weeks; 5 will
consider it a moderate or serious problem
• 66 out of 100 people have blood in their urine; in 20 of them, it will last for at least
2 weeks; 6 will consider it a moderate or serious problem
• 37 out of 100 people have blood in their bowel movements; in 5 of them, it will last for at
least 2 weeks; 2 will consider it a moderate or serious problem
• 90 out of 100 people have blood in their semen; in 60 of them, it will last for at least
2 weeks; 25 will consider it a moderate or serious problem.

1.2.5

Do not offer mapping transperineal template biopsy as part of an initial
assessment, unless as part of a clinical trial. [2019]

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they
might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on MRI and biopsy.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review D:
diagnosing and identifying clinically significant prostate cancer.
1.2.6

Help people decide whether to have an MRI or prostate biopsy by discussing:
• their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level
• their digital rectal examination (DRE) findings (including an estimate of prostate size)
• any comorbidities, together with their risk factors (including increasing age and black
African–Caribbean family background)
• any history of a previous negative prostate biopsy.
Do not automatically offer a prostate biopsy on the basis of serum PSA level alone.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

1.2.7

Give people and their partners or carers information, support and adequate
time to decide whether or not they wish to have an MRI or prostate biopsy.
Explain the risks (including the increased chance of having to live with the
diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer) and benefits. [2008]

1.2.8

If the clinical suspicion of prostate cancer is high, because of a high PSA value
and evidence of bone metastases (identified by a positive isotope bone scan or
sclerotic metastases on plain radiographs), do not offer prostate biopsy for
histological confirmation unless this is needed as part of a clinical trial. [2008]

1.2.9

Have a core member of the urological cancer MDT review the risk factors of all
people who have had a negative first prostate biopsy. Discuss with the person
that:
• there is still a risk that prostate cancer is present and
• the risk is slightly higher if any of the following risk factors are present:
－ the biopsy showed high-grade prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (HGPIN)
－ the biopsy showed atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP)
－ abnormal DRE. [2014]

If the MRI or biopsy is negative
1.2.10

For people with a negative biopsy who have an MRI Likert score of 3 or more,
discuss the possibility of significant disease in an MDT meeting with a view to
repeating the prostate biopsy. [2019]

1.2.11

For people who have a raised PSA and MRI Likert score of 1 or 2, and who have
not had a prostate biopsy, repeat PSA test at 3 to 6 months and:
• offer prostate biopsy if there is a strong suspicion of prostate cancer (for example, PSA
density greater than 0.15 nanogram/ml/ml or PSA velocity greater than
0.75 nanogram/ml/year, or strong family history), taking into account their life
expectancy and comorbidities

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

• discharge the person to primary care if the level of suspicion is low; advise PSA follow
up at 6 months and then every year, and set a PSA level for primary care at which to
re-refer based on PSA density (0.15 nanogram/ml/ml) or velocity (0.75 nanogram/ml/
year). [2019]
1.2.12

For people who have a raised PSA, an MRI Likert score of 1 or 2 (or a
contraindication to MRI), and negative biopsy, repeat PSA at 3 to 6 months and:
• offer prostate biopsy if there is a strong suspicion of prostate cancer (for example, PSA
density greater than 0.15 nanogram/ml/ml or PSA velocity greater than
0.75 nanogram/ml/year, or strong family history), taking into account their life
expectancy and comorbidities
• discharge the person to primary care if the level of suspicion is low; advise PSA
follow up every 2 years, and set a PSA level for primary care at which to re-refer, based
on PSA density (0.15 nanogram/ml/ml) or velocity (0.75 nanogram/ml/year). [2019]

1.2.13

The PROGENSA PCA3 assay and the Prostate Health Index is not
recommended in people having investigations for suspected prostate cancer
who have had a negative or inconclusive prostate biopsy. [2019]

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they
might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on if the MRI or biopsy is negative.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review E: following
up people at risk of prostate cancer.

Staging
CT for histologically proven prostate cancer
1.2.14

Consider CT for people with histologically proven prostate cancer for whom
MRI is contraindicated if knowledge of the T or N stage could affect
management. [2014]

Risk stratification for localised or locally advanced prostate cancer
1.2.15

Urological cancer MDTs should assign a risk category (see table 1) to all people
with newly diagnosed localised or locally advanced prostate cancer. [2021]

Box 2 Factors to consider when discussing active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or
radical radiotherapy as treatment options for people with CPG 1, 2 and 3 localised prostate
cancer, using evidence from a large UK trial
What are the treatment options for people with localised prostate cancer?
There are 3 options for treatment:
• active surveillance (the trial used the intention-to-treat method of analysis and some of
the patients in the active surveillance arm may therefore have undergone prostatectomy
or radiotherapy during the follow-up period)
• radical prostatectomy
• radical radiotherapy.
What effect does each treatment option have on survival at 10 years?
The evidence does not show a difference in the number of deaths from prostate cancer
among people offered active surveillance, prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy.
People who had not died of prostate cancer were:
• 98 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 99 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 99 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
What effect does each treatment option have on disease progression at 10 years?
There is good evidence that both prostatectomy and radiotherapy reduce disease progression
compared with active surveillance.
Signs of disease progression were reported in:
• 21 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

• 8 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 8 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
The trial defined disease progression as:
• evidence of metastases or
• diagnosis of clinical T3 or T4 disease or
• need for long-term androgen deprivation therapy or
• rectal fistula or the need for a urinary catheter owing to local tumour growth.
Disease progression was suspected if there was:
• any rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of more than 20% between consecutive
measures at any time during follow up or
• any rise in PSA level of 50% or more in any 12-month period confirmed by repeat tests or
• any indication of the appearance of symptomatic systemic disease.
What effect does each treatment option have on the rate of development of distant
metastases at 10 years?
There is good evidence that both prostatectomy and radiotherapy reduce the rate of
development of distant metastases compared with active surveillance.
Distant metastases were developed in:
• 8 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 3 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 3 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
What effect does each treatment option have on urinary function?

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

There is some evidence that urinary function is better for people offered active surveillance
or radiotherapy than those offered prostatectomy.
At 6 months, problems with urinary continence were reported in:
• 39 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 71 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 38 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
At 6 years, problems with urinary continence were reported in:
• 50 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 69 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 49 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
At 6 months, moderate to severe urinary incontinence problems were reported in:
• 4 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 19 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 6 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
At 6 years, moderate to severe urinary incontinence problems were reported in:
• 8 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 13 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 5 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
What effect does each treatment option have on erectile dysfunction?
There is some limited evidence that sexual function is better for people offered active
surveillance or radiotherapy than those offered prostatectomy.

At 6 months, moderate or severe problems with erectile dysfunction were reported in:
• 29 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 66 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 48 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.

• 40 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 50 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 36 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
What effect does each treatment option have on bowel function?
There is some evidence that bowel function is better for people offered active surveillance or
prostatectomy than those offered radiotherapy in the short term.
At 6 months, problems with faecal incontinence more than once per week were reported in:
• 2 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 1 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 5 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
At 6 years, problems with faecal incontinence more than once per week were reported in:
• 3 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance
• 2 out of 100 patients offered radical prostatectomy
• 4 out of 100 patients offered radical radiotherapy.
At 6 months, moderate to severe impact of bowel habits on quality of life was reported in:
• 3 out of 100 patients offered active surveillance

1.3.8

For people with CPG 1 localised prostate cancer:
• offer active surveillance
• consider radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy if active surveillance is not
suitable or acceptable to the person. [2019, amended 2021]

Multiparametric MRI and protocol for active surveillance
1.3.13

Offer multiparametric MRI to people having active surveillance who have not
had an MRI previously. If the MRI results do not agree with the biopsy findings,
offer a new MRI-influenced biopsy. [2019]

1.3.14

Consider using the protocol in table 2 for people who have chosen active
surveillance. [2019]

Table 2 Protocol for active surveillance

Timing

Tests (if there is concern about clinical or prostate-specific antigen changes
at any time during active surveillance, reassess with multiparametric MRI
and/or re-biopsy)
Every 3 to 4 months: measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA; could be
carried out in primary care if there are agreed shared-care protocols and
recall systems)

Year 1 of active
surveillance

Throughout active surveillance: monitor PSA kinetics (could include PSA
density and velocity)
At 12 months: digital rectal examination (DRE; should be done by a
healthcare professional with expertise and confidence in performing DRE.
In a large UK trial that informed this protocol, DREs were carried out by a
urologist or a nurse specialist)
At 12 to 18 months: multiparametric MRI

are cost effective. [2014]
1.3.19

For people having radical external beam radiotherapy for localised prostate
cancer:
• offer hypofractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy in 20 fractions) using image-guided
intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), unless contraindicated or
• offer conventional radiotherapy (74 Gy in 37 fractions) to people who cannot have
hypofractionated radiotherapy. [2019]

Offer people with localised and locally advanced prostate cancer receiving
radical external beam radiotherapy with curative intent planned treatment
techniques that optimise the dose to the tumour while minimising the risks of
normal tissue damage. [2008]

1.3.21

Offer people with CPG 2, 3, 4 and 5 localised or locally advanced prostate
cancer a combination of radical radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy,
rather than radical radiotherapy or androgen deprivation therapy alone. [2014,
amended 2021]

1.3.22

Discuss the option of docetaxel chemotherapy with people who have newly
diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer who:
• are starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy and
• have no significant comorbidities and
• have high-risk disease, as shown by:
－ T3/T4 staging or

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

NICE's interventional procedures guidance on high-intensity focused
ultrasound for prostate cancer, cryotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer and
cryotherapy as a primary treatment for prostate cancer evaluated the safety
and efficacy of cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound for the
treatment of prostate cancer. NICE guidelines provide guidance on the
appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions
within the NHS. Because there was a lack of evidence on quality-of-life benefits
and long-term survival, these interventions are not recommended in this
guideline.
NICE's interventional procedures guidance on focal therapy using high-intensity
focused ultrasound for localised prostate cancer and focal therapy using
cryoablation for localised prostate cancer found no major safety concerns, but
evidence on efficacy is limited in quantity and there is a concern that prostate
cancer is commonly multifocal.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Box 3 Factors to consider when discussing the option of docetaxel chemotherapy for people
with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer
What does treatment with docetaxel involve?
Docetaxel chemotherapy is given at 6 appointments, each 3 weeks apart. It is given as an
intravenous infusion that takes about 1 hour.
What are the benefits of docetaxel treatment for people with high-risk, non-metastatic
prostate cancer?
There is clear, high-quality evidence that docetaxel chemotherapy delays disease progression
in people with high-risk, non-metastatic disease.
In a large UK randomised trial (James et al. 2016), the average person who did not receive
docetaxel experienced disease progression about 5 years after the start of the trial, whereas
the average person receiving docetaxel experienced disease progression after about 6 years.
We do not yet know whether docetaxel improves survival in people with high-risk, nonmetastatic disease and we will only be confident about whether it does when trials have been
running for longer.
In a large UK randomised trial, 80 out of 100 people with high-risk disease who did not
receive docetaxel were still alive after 5 years compared with 84 out of 100 people who did.
However, this difference could be because of chance.
What are the risks associated with docetaxel treatment?
A large UK randomised trial found that:
• 15 out of 100 people who took docetaxel developed febrile neutropenia (that is, they got
a fever because the chemotherapy had reduced their white blood cells' ability to fight
infection).
• 1 out of 100 people who took docetaxel died because of infections that, in the opinion of
the investigators, they might not have developed if they had not received docetaxel.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

• 8 out of 100 people who took docetaxel felt unusually weak or tired.
• 8 out of 100 people who took docetaxel experienced gastrointestinal symptoms
(including diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and/or vomiting).
• 5 out of 100 people who took docetaxel experienced respiratory symptoms (including
breathlessness and/or chest infections).
• 4 out of 100 people who took docetaxel experienced problems with their nervous
systems (for example, numbness or weakness).
• 1 out of 100 people who took docetaxel experienced problems with their nails that were
serious enough to interfere with their daily lives.

For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendations on docetaxel
chemotherapy and how they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on
docetaxel chemotherapy.
Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review B: docetaxel
in people with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.

Watchful waiting
1.3.29

People with localised prostate cancer who have chosen watchful waiting and
who have evidence of significant disease progression (that is, rapidly rising PSA
level or bone pain) should have their situation reviewed by a member of the
urological cancer MDT. [2008]

Locally advanced prostate cancer
1.3.30

Consider pelvic radiotherapy for people with locally advanced prostate cancer
who have a higher than 15% risk of pelvic lymph node involvement and who are
to receive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and radical radiotherapy. [2008]

1.3.31

Risk of pelvic node lymph involvement estimated using the Roach formula: %LN
risk = 2/3 PSA + (10 × [Gleason score - 6]).

1.3.32

Do not offer immediate post-operative radiotherapy after radical
prostatectomy, even to people with margin-positive disease, other than in the
context of a clinical trial. [2008]

1.3.33

Do not offer adjuvant hormonal therapy in addition to radical prostatectomy,
even to people with margin-positive disease, other than in the context of a
clinical trial. [2008]

1.3.34

Do not offer high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy to people with
locally advanced prostate cancer other than in the context of controlled clinical
trials comparing their use with established interventions. [2008]
NICE's interventional procedures guidance on high-intensity focused
ultrasound for prostate cancer, cryotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer and
cryotherapy as a primary treatment for prostate cancer evaluated the safety
and efficacy of cryotherapy and high-intensity focused ultrasound for the
treatment of prostate cancer. NICE guidelines provide guidance on the
appropriate treatment and care of people with specific diseases and conditions
within the NHS. Because there was a lack of evidence on quality-of-life benefits
and long-term survival, these interventions are not recommended in this
guideline.

1.3.35

Do not offer bisphosphonates for the prevention of bone metastases in people
with prostate cancer. [2008]

Managing adverse effects of radical treatment
Sexual dysfunction
1.3.36

Offer people who have had radical treatment for prostate cancer access to
specialist erectile dysfunction services. [2008, amended 2014]

1.3.37

Offer people with prostate cancer who experience loss of erectile function
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors to improve their chance of
spontaneous erections. [2008]

1.3.38

If PDE5 inhibitors do not restore erectile function or are contraindicated, offer
people vacuum devices, intraurethral inserts or penile injections, or penile
prostheses as an alternative. [2008]

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Urinary incontinence
1.3.39

Ensure that people with prostate cancer who have troublesome urinary
symptoms after treatment have access to specialist continence services for
assessment, diagnosis and conservative treatment. This could include coping
strategies, pelvic floor muscle re-education, bladder retraining and
pharmacotherapy. [2008]

1.3.40

Refer people with prostate cancer who have intractable stress incontinence to a
specialist surgeon for consideration of an artificial urinary sphincter. [2008]

1.3.41

Do not offer injection of bulking agents into the distal urinary sphincter to treat
stress incontinence in people with prostate cancer. [2008]

Radiation-induced enteropathy
1.3.42

Offer people with signs or symptoms of radiation-induced enteropathy care
from a team of professionals with expertise in radiation-induced enteropathy
(who may include oncologists, gastroenterologists, bowel surgeons, dietitians
and specialist nurses). [2014]

1.3.43

Include the nature and treatment of radiation-induced enteropathy in training
programmes for oncologists and gastroenterologists. [2014]

1.3.44

Carry out full investigations, including flexible sigmoidoscopy, in people who
have symptoms of radiation-induced enteropathy to exclude inflammatory
bowel disease or malignancy of the large bowel and to ascertain the nature of
the radiation injury. Use caution when performing anterior wall rectal biopsy
after brachytherapy because of the risk of fistulation. [2014]

Follow up for people with localised or locally advanced prostate
cancer having radical treatment or on watchful waiting
1.3.45

A urologist or specialist nurse should discuss the purpose, duration, frequency
and location of follow up with each person with localised and locally advanced
prostate cancer, and if they wish, their partner or carers. [2019]

1.3.46

A urologist or specialist nurse should advise people with prostate cancer about
potential longer-term adverse effects of treatment and when and how to report

them. [2019]
1.3.47

Check PSA levels for all people with prostate cancer who are having radical
treatment no earlier than 6 weeks after treatment, at least every 6 months for
the first 2 years, and then at least once a year after that. [2019]

1.3.48

Do not routinely offer DRE to people with localised prostate cancer who are not
on active surveillance while their PSA remains at baseline levels. [2019]

1.3.49

After at least 6 months' initial follow up, consider a remote follow-up strategy
for people with a stable PSA who have had no significant treatment
complications, unless they are taking part in a clinical trial that needs formal
clinic-based follow up. [2019]

1.3.50

Follow up people with prostate cancer who have chosen a watchful waiting
regimen with no curative intent in primary care only if protocols for this have
been agreed between the local urological cancer MDT and the relevant primary
care organisation(s). Measure their PSA at least once a year. [2019]

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they
might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on follow up.

protocols after radical treatment.

Managing relapse after radical treatment
1.3.51

Analyse serial PSA levels after radical treatment using the same assay technique
as used before. [2008]

1.3.52

Do not offer biopsy of the prostatic bed to people with prostate cancer who
have had a radical prostatectomy. [2008]

1.3.53

Only offer biopsy of the prostate after radiotherapy to people with prostate
cancer who might have local salvage therapy in the context of a clinical trial.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

1.3.54

For people with evidence of biochemical relapse after radical treatment who are
thinking about having radical salvage therapy:
• do not offer routine MRI scanning before salvage radiotherapy in people with prostate
cancer
• offer an isotope bone scan if symptoms or PSA trends are suggestive of metastases.
[2008]

1.3.55

Take into account that biochemical relapse (a rising PSA) alone should not mean
an immediate change in treatment is needed. [2008]

1.3.56

Estimate PSA doubling time if biochemical relapse occurs. Base this on a
minimum of 3 measurements over at least a 6-month period. [2008]

1.3.57

Offer people with biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy, with no
known metastases, radical radiotherapy to the prostatic bed. [2008]

1.3.58

Consider entry to appropriate clinical trials for people with biochemical relapse.
[2008]

1.3.59

Do not routinely offer hormonal therapy to people with prostate cancer who
have a biochemical relapse unless they have:
• symptomatic local disease progression or
• any proven metastases or
• a PSA doubling time of less than 3 months. [2008]

1.4 People having hormone therapy
1.4.1

Consider intermittent therapy for people having long-term androgen
deprivation therapy (not in the adjuvant setting). Discuss with the person (and
their partner, family or carers if they wish):
• the rationale for intermittent therapy
• the limited evidence for reduction in side effects from intermittent therapy

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

• the effect of intermittent therapy on progression of prostate cancer. [2014]
1.4.2

For people who are having intermittent androgen deprivation therapy:
• measure PSA every 3 months and
• restart androgen deprivation therapy if PSA is 10 nanogram/ml or above, or if there is
symptomatic progression. [2014]

Managing adverse effects of hormone therapy
Hot flushes
1.4.3

Offer medroxyprogesterone (20 mg per day), initially for 10 weeks, to manage
troublesome hot flushes caused by long-term androgen suppression. Evaluate
the effect at the end of the treatment period. [2014]
In May 2019, this was an off-label use of medroxyprogesterone. See NICE's
guidance on prescribing medicines for further information.

1.4.4

Consider cyproterone acetate (50 mg twice a day for 4 weeks) to treat
troublesome hot flushes if medroxyprogesterone is not effective or not
tolerated. [2014]

1.4.5

Tell people that there is no good-quality evidence for the use of complementary
therapies to treat troublesome hot flushes. [2014]

Sexual dysfunction
1.4.6

Before they start androgen deprivation therapy, tell people and, if they wish,
their partner, that long-term androgen deprivation will cause a reduction in
libido and possible loss of sexual function. [2014]

1.4.7

Advise people and, if they wish, their partner, about the potential loss of
ejaculation and fertility associated with long-term androgen deprivation and
offer sperm storage. [2014]

1.4.8

Ensure that people starting androgen deprivation therapy have access to
specialist erectile dysfunction services. [2014]

1.4.9

Consider referring people who are having long-term androgen deprivation
therapy, and their partners, for psychosexual counselling. [2014]

1.4.10

Offer PDE5 inhibitors to people having long-term androgen deprivation therapy
who experience loss of erectile function. [2014]

1.4.11

If PDE5 inhibitors fail to restore erectile function or are contraindicated, offer a
choice of:
• intraurethral inserts
• penile injections
• penile prostheses
• vacuum devices. [2014]

Osteoporosis
1.4.12

Do not routinely offer bisphosphonates to prevent osteoporosis in people with
prostate cancer having androgen deprivation therapy. [2008]

1.4.13

Consider assessing fracture risk in people with prostate cancer who are having
androgen deprivation therapy, in line with the NICE guideline on osteoporosis:
assessing the risk of fragility fracture. [2014]

1.4.14

Offer bisphosphonates to people who are having androgen deprivation therapy
and have osteoporosis. [2014]

1.4.15

Consider denosumab for people who are having androgen deprivation therapy
and have osteoporosis if bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated.
[2014]

Gynaecomastia
1.4.16

For people starting long-term bicalutamide monotherapy (longer than
6 months), offer prophylactic radiotherapy to both breast buds within the first
month of treatment. Use a single fraction of 8 Gy using orthovoltage, or electron
beam radiotherapy. [2008]

1.4.17

If radiotherapy does not prevent gynaecomastia, consider weekly tamoxifen.
[2008]
In May 2019, this was an off-label use of tamoxifen. See NICE's guidance on
prescribing medicines for further information.

Fatigue
1.4.18

Tell people who are starting androgen deprivation therapy that fatigue is a
recognised side effect of this therapy, and might not be because of their
prostate cancer. [2014]

1.4.19

Offer people who are starting or having androgen deprivation therapy
supervised resistance and aerobic exercise at least twice a week for 12 weeks to
reduce fatigue and improve quality of life. [2014]

1.5 Metastatic prostate cancer
Information and support
1.5.1

Offer people with metastatic prostate cancer tailored information and access to
specialist urology and palliative care teams to address their specific needs. Give
them the opportunity to discuss any significant changes in their disease status
or symptoms as these occur. [2008]

1.5.2

Integrate palliative interventions at any stage into coordinated care, and
facilitate any transitions between care settings as smoothly as possible. [2008]

1.5.3

Discuss personal preferences for palliative care as early as possible with people
with metastatic prostate cancer, their partners and carers. Tailor treatment/
care plans accordingly, and identify the preferred place of care. [2008]

1.5.4

Ensure that palliative care is available when needed and is not limited to the end
of life. Care should not be restricted to being associated with hospice care.

Hormone-relapsed metastatic prostate cancer
Recommendations 1.5.12, 1.5.13 and 1.5.14 are from the NICE technology appraisal guidance
on docetaxel for the treatment of hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

1.5.11

Discuss the treatment options for people with prostate cancer who develop
biochemical evidence of hormone-relapsed disease at the urological cancer
MDT. Seek an oncologist and/or specialist palliative care opinion, as
appropriate. [2008]

1.5.12

Docetaxel is recommended, within its licensed indications, as a treatment
option for people with hormone-refractory prostate cancer only if their
Karnofsky Performance-Status score is 60% or more. [2008]

1.5.13

It is recommended that treatment with docetaxel should be stopped:
• at the completion of planned treatment of up to 10 cycles or
• if severe adverse events occur or
• in the presence of progression of disease as evidenced by clinical or laboratory criteria,
or by imaging studies. [2008]

1.5.14

Repeat cycles of treatment with docetaxel are not recommended if the disease
recurs after completion of the planned course of chemotherapy. [2008]

1.5.15

Offer a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone (0.5 mg daily) as third-line
hormonal therapy after androgen deprivation therapy and anti-androgen

Terms used in this guideline
Active surveillance
This is part of a 'curative' strategy and is aimed at people with localised prostate cancer for whom
radical treatments are suitable, keeping them within a 'window of curability' whereby only those
whose tumours are showing signs of progressing, or those with a preference for intervention are
considered for radical treatment. Active surveillance may thus avoid or delay the need for
radiotherapy or surgery.

External beam radiotherapy (EBRT)
This is radiotherapy given by using ionising radiation (for example, high-energy X-rays) produced in
a machine and directed at the tumour from outside the patient.

Grade group
This refers to the 2019 International Society of Urological Pathology grade groupings for prostate
cancer.

Hormone-relapsed (also known as hormone-resistant, hormonerefractory and castrate-resistant) prostate cancer
Refers to prostate cancer after failure of primary androgen deprivation therapy.

Locally advanced prostate cancer
For the purposes of this guideline, this includes T3 and T4 prostate cancer.

Localised prostate cancer
Cancer that has been staged as T1 or T2 (confined to the prostate gland).

Multiparametric MRI of the prostate
An MRI study that incorporates anatomical and functional information about the prostate. The
minimum functional information includes T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic
contrast-enhanced imaging.

Multiparametric MRI-influenced prostate biopsy
The information from the multiparametric MRI scan taken before prostate biopsy is used to
determine the best needle placement. In rare cases, the biopsy may be MRI-guided (the needle is
inserted within the MRI machine). In most cases, the biopsy that follows the multiparametric MRI
will be ultrasound-guided, but the specific area(s) targeted will be predetermined by the
multiparametric MRI data.

Prostatectomy
Surgery to remove part, or all of the prostate gland. Radical prostatectomy aims at the removal of
the entire prostate gland and lymph nodes. This can be done by an open approach or by keyhole
technique (laparoscopic or robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy).

Prostate biopsy
Template biopsy and mapping template biopsy
A template biopsy is normally done under a general anaesthetic, and involves taking transperineal
core biopsies using a grid system. This might involve taking multiple cores from multiple sites, but
usually 2 to 3 cores from 8 sites. A mapping template biopsy is when 20 sites are systematically
sampled, with 2 or 3 cores per site, sometimes meaning over 50 core biopsies are taken.

Local anaesthetic transperineal biopsy
This is sampling 6 or 8 sites from the prostate using a transperineal route under local anaesthetic.

Transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS)
This is when core biopsies of the prostate are taken via the rectum under local anaesthetic.

Systematic versus MRI-influenced (targeted) biopsy
The site for biopsy can be targeted based on multiparametric MRI findings, or systematically but
not guided by MRI. Most often there is a combination of both targeted and systematic MRI. The
method used for the biopsy can be either transperineal or TRUS.

Watchful waiting
This is part of a strategy for 'controlling' rather than 'curing' prostate cancer and is aimed at people

with localised prostate cancer who do not ever wish to have curative treatment, or it is not suitable
for them. Instead, it involves the deferred use of hormone therapy. Watchful waiting avoids the use
of surgery or radiation, but implies that curative treatment will not be attempted.

Recommendations for research
The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.
As part of the 2021 update, the guideline committee made an additional recommendation for
research on the diagnostic accuracy of staging investigations for Cambridge Prognostic Group
(CPG) 3 prostate cancer.

Key recommendations for research
1 Follow up during active surveillance
What is the most suitable surveillance protocol (including the role of digital rectal examination
[DRE] and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] measures) for people for whom active surveillance is
appropriate, as assessed by multiparametric MRI and biopsy, when there are no clinical concerns
during follow up?

For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research, see the
rationale section on multiparametric MRI for active surveillance.

2 Follow up after radical treatment
What is the most clinically and cost-effective follow-up protocol for people with prostate cancer
who have had radical treatment, with specific regard to risk stratification, duration of follow up,
frequency of follow-up appointments, the type of examination or blood tests, and the roles of
primary and secondary care in follow up?

Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how they might
affect practice. They link to details of the evidence and a full description of the committee's
discussion.

MRI and biopsy
Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.5

Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee saw no new evidence to suggest that any changes were needed to the
recommendations on imaging in people who are not going to have radical treatment.
There was good evidence that showed that multiparametric MRI is useful in identifying lesions
before biopsy, and the combination of MRI with prostate biopsy leads to better identification of
clinically significant prostate cancer than systematic prostate biopsy alone. The committee
recommended using a 5-point Likert scale because this scale takes into account clinical factors and
not just the lesion size, improving the diagnostic ability of multiparametric MRI.
The committee made a recommendation to consider omitting prostate biopsy for people whose
multiparametric MRI Likert score is 1 or 2 because there was some evidence that this is safe to do.
However, there is a small risk that in some cases significant cancers may be missed, so the
committee recommended clinicians discuss the risk and benefits with the person.
Based on their expertise and economic evidence, the committee recommended not offering
mapping transperineal template biopsy as an initial biopsy, because the technique is currently too
resource intensive to be used as an initial assessment – it requires general anaesthetic and
extensive histological analysis. The committee recognised that this technique could be allowed as
part of a clinical trial because it is often used as the benchmark or gold standard test in those trials.
The committee did not see any evidence that allowed them to clearly differentiate between
transperineal (non-mapping) and transrectal biopsy, so it agreed to refer to 'prostate biopsy'
throughout the recommendations.
As there was limited evidence on the most effective pathway for excluding clinically significant
progression of prostate cancer in people with low to intermediate risk, the committee made a

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

recommendation for research on this topic. They also identified that there was a gap in the
evidence on the most suitable surveillance protocol in this population group.

How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations should not have a significant resource impact as many centres already
perform MRI-influenced biopsy. Since all people who have a biopsy will previously have had an MRI,
using the MRI to target the biopsy will be more efficient and need fewer biopsy cores to be taken.
Health economic evidence shows that MRI-influenced prostate biopsy may be more cost effective
than systematic prostate biopsy as it takes less time and is more efficient in identifying clinically
significant cancer.
Return to recommendations

If the MRI or biopsy is negative
Recommendations 1.2.10 to 1.2.13

Why the committee made the recommendations
There was no clinical evidence in this area, therefore the committee used evidence from economic
modelling that showed people with a negative diagnosis of prostate cancer can still be at
substantial risk of having prostate cancer, so follow up is important. The evidence showed that the
prevalence of initially undetected, but clinically significant, prostate cancer varies based on a
person's diagnostic history, so their diagnostic history should influence the frequency of follow up.
The committee recommended that people with a Likert 3 score should be discussed at a
multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. It made the recommendation because these cases can be
difficult to deal with. Scoring of scans may fluctuate by 20% between raters and therefore a
discussion in an MDT is warranted. The committee noted that this does not necessarily imply the
full cancer MDT, but is subject to local arrangement.
The follow-up strategies recommended for primary care are based on standard prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) tests, with which primary care healthcare professionals are familiar. The committee
agreed it was important that specialist healthcare professionals should calculate thresholds for
re-referral and provide these when discharging people, rather than expecting the calculations to be
made in primary care.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

(NICE diagnostic guidance 17) are updated by this guideline. The committee saw no evidence that
either technique represents an effective use of NHS resources in the follow up of people who have
had a negative transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) prostate biopsy, and therefore the committee
did not recommend use of these technologies.
The committee identified a gap in the evidence for the performance of transperineal route (nonmapping) biopsy, and therefore made a recommendation for research in this area.
The committee also noted that there is limited long-term follow-up evidence on the natural history
of people whose multiparametric MRI Likert score is 1 or 2. In addition, there is limited evidence on
the number of people whose multiparametric MRI is Likert score 1 or 2, who have normal PSA
density and kinetics and who are found to have clinically significant cancer. Further
recommendations for research were made in these areas to help provide evidence across the
prostate cancer treatment pathway.

How the recommendations might affect practice
Currently, there is substantial variation in clinical practice in the follow up of people with a negative
prostate biopsy. The committee's recommendations should help to standardise practice.
Other recommendations made by the committee make it likely that more people will have a
negative diagnosis on the basis of low-risk multiparametric MRI findings and no biopsy. This is a
new population who will need effective follow-up strategies, and the recommendations give
guidance on approaches that are likely to provide a good balance of benefits, harms and costs for
this group.
The committee were confident that none of the recommendations would have a significant
resource impact, as they are based on PSA measurements that are commonly used within primary
care settings. In addition, if further multiparametric MRI is needed during follow up, the evidence
showed that MRI-influenced prostate biopsy may be more cost effective than systematic prostate
biopsy, as it takes less time and is more efficient in identifying clinically significant cancer.

Risk stratification for localised or locally advanced
prostate cancer
Recommendation 1.2.15

Page 45

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Why the committee made the recommendation
The 2019 guideline used a 3-tier model for risk stratification. The committee agreed that newer
evidence shows 5-tier risk stratification models are better at predicting prostate cancer-specific
mortality than 3-tier models. More accurate prognosis will mean that more people are given the
most effective treatment. The committee recommended the 5-tier Cambridge Prognostic Group
(CPG) model over other 5-tier models because it has been tested in UK populations.

Impact on other recommendations
The committee considered the impact of recommending the CPG risk stratification model on other
recommendations in the guideline. Recommendations were amended as necessary, taking into
account the original evidence for each recommendation and the committee's knowledge and
experience.

How the recommendation might affect practice
The committee were confident that recommending the 5-tier CPG risk stratification model would
not have a significant resource impact. This was because the same information is used to calculate
both the CPG model and the previously recommended 3-tier model. However, MDTs will need to be
aware of the new 5-tier model when assessing patient risk.
Under the 5-tier CPG risk stratification model more people would be in the lowest risk group
(CPG 1) than were previously categorised as 'low risk'. The previous 'intermediate-risk' group now
consists of some people in CPG 1, and all people in CPG 2 and CPG 3, and recommendations that
were previously for people at 'intermediate risk' would now apply to a smaller group. CPG 4 and
CPG 5 directly align to the previous 'high-risk' group, so the number of people in this category
would not change. These changes are not expected to affect treatment choices in a way that would
have a significant resource impact.

Bone scans for newly diagnosed prostate cancer
Recommendation 1.2.16

Why the committee made the recommendation
The 2019 guideline recommended that bone scans should not be used for people with low-risk

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

prostate cancer. This recommendation was amended to refer to the CPG 1 and 2 populations. The
committee were aware that this population is broader than the original low-risk population, but
agreed that it was in line with current practice not to offer bone scans to these groups because they
have very low risks of bone metastases. The committee highlighted the lack of evidence on when to
offer staging investigations to the CPG 3 group and the potential resource impact of the
investigations, and made a recommendation for research in this area.

How the recommendation might affect practice
Recommendations where low risk was replaced with CPG 1 and 2 will apply to a broader
population due to the inclusion of people with T2b prostate cancer. However, the committee
agreed that the associated resource impact of this change would be minimal because it is in line
with current practice.
Return to recommendation

Treatment options for localised and locally advanced
prostate cancer
Recommendations 1.3.7 to 1.3.12

Why the committee made the recommendations
Choosing between treatment options
The committee agreed that active surveillance, radical radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy may
be suitable for different people. Therefore, it included a preference decision box for clinicians to
use to help people with prostate cancer make the right choice for themselves. The information in
the box comes from the UK ProtecT trial, which included people with CPG 1 to 3 prostate cancer.
However, the committee noted that people with CPG 3 prostate cancer comprised a small
proportion of the people in this trial. Therefore, the information in the box might not directly apply
to this group, but may still be useful when discussing the risk of side effects for different treatment
options.

CPG 1 prostate cancer
The 2019 guideline recommended that a choice of active surveillance, radical radiotherapy or
radical prostatectomy should be offered to people with low-risk prostate cancer (equivalent to the
CPG 1 group in the 5-tier model that is now recommended). The committee noted that since the

Page 47

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

2019 guideline was published, practice in this area has changed and there is now more concern
about overtreatment of low-risk cancer. They noted that the UK ProtecT trial, which is most
applicable to the population with CPG 1 prostate cancer, showed statistically significant benefit
from radical treatment and a higher risk of adverse events. It was therefore recommended that
active surveillance should be offered to people with CPG 1 prostate cancer and radical treatment
considered if active surveillance is not acceptable or unsuitable.

CPG 2 prostate cancer
In the 2019 guideline, radical treatment was recommended for people with intermediate-risk
prostate cancer, with active surveillance considered if this was unacceptable to the person with
prostate cancer. The CPG model divides this intermediate-risk group into CPG 2 and CPG 3
prostate cancer and the committee made different recommendations for these groups because
they have different risks of prostate cancer related mortality. The committee recommended that
people with CPG 2 prostate cancer should be offered a choice of radical prostatectomy, radical
radiotherapy or active surveillance. The ProtecT trial included people with CPG 2 prostate cancer.
However, the risk of prostate cancer related mortality is higher in the CPG 2 population than in
people with CPG 1 prostate cancer and so the choice between active surveillance and radical
treatment is more finely balanced.

CPG 3 prostate cancer
Radical prostatectomy or radical radiotherapy was recommended for people with CPG 3 prostate
cancer, in line with the 2019 recommendation for people with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.
This is because the risk of prostate cancer related mortality is higher for this group than the CPG 2
group and the committee thought that the survival benefit from radical treatment would likely
outweigh the side effects. The committee also recommended that active surveillance could be
considered if radical treatment is unacceptable to the patient, in line with the 2019
recommendation.

CPG 4 and 5 prostate cancer
The 2019 recommendation not to offer active surveillance to people with high-risk prostate cancer
was updated to refer to people with CPG 4 and 5 prostate cancer. The committee agreed that these
groups were equivalent, and that active surveillance would not be a suitable treatment option for
these people.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

How the recommendations might affect practice
Recommendations where low risk was replaced with CPG 1 are likely to apply to a broader
population due to the inclusion of people with T2b prostate cancer. However, the committee
agreed that the associated resource impact of this change would be minimal because although
there is more emphasis on active surveillance, the other treatment options are still available.
Return to recommendations

Multiparametric MRI for active surveillance
Recommendations 1.3.13 and 1.3.14

Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee made recommendations based on a good body of evidence that multiparametric
MRI can be used as part of an active surveillance protocol to identify clinically significant cancer, or
restage prostate cancer after diagnosis. The committee took into account the benefits seen in using
multiparametric MRI pre-biopsy in people who have not had a biopsy and who have suspected
prostate cancer. The committee concluded that this benefit can be extended to people having
active surveillance without having had an MRI to allow for confirmation or reclassification of the
prostate cancer.
The committee amended the protocol for active surveillance based on their expertise and good
evidence on PSA-derived measures to monitor, and the use of multiparametric MRI to identify,
clinically significant prostate cancer. The committee kept the use of digital rectal examination
(DRE) in this population because they did not see any new evidence to not recommend it for this
group. In addition, DRE was part of the protocol in 1 of the studies included in the evidence review.
Because of the limited evidence on the most effective pathway for excluding clinically significant
progression of prostate cancer in people with low to intermediate risk, the committee made
recommendations for research in this area. They also identified that there was a gap in the
evidence on the most suitable surveillance protocol for this population group, including the use of
DRE.

How the recommendations might affect practice
The use of multiparametric MRI in people who are enrolled on active surveillance will influence
active surveillance protocols across the country. Multiparametric MRI is clinically and cost

effective, because clinically significant cancers are more likely to be identified, therefore decisions
on treatment can be made earlier in the diagnosis pathway saving on future treatment costs.
Return to recommendations

Radiotherapy
Recommendations 1.3.19 and 1.3.21 to 1.3.25

Why the committee made the recommendations
The 2014 and 2019 recommendations on hormone treatment and brachytherapy for intermediate
and high-risk prostate cancer were amended to cover the CPG 2 to 5 groups. The committee
agreed these groups are broadly equivalent to the groups in the 2019 guideline and reflect the
populations that will have radical radiotherapy. The recommendations for high-risk prostate cancer
were amended to CPG 4 and 5 as these are the equivalent groups.
In 2019, the committee considered a large body of evidence showing that hypofractionated
radiotherapy and conventional radiotherapy were equally effective. The committee noted that
hypofractionated radiotherapy is associated with higher rates of acute gastrointestinal toxicity, but
overall it could enable people to have a better quality of life because they would need to make
fewer clinic visits. Fewer clinic visits for hypofractionated radiotherapy would also mean fewer
resources were needed compared with conventional radiotherapy treatment. Therefore,
hypofractionated radiotherapy was recommended as the first option.
The committee agreed that 60 Gy in 20 fractions was the optimal dose for people having
hypofractionated radiotherapy. This was the dosage used in the large UK CHHiP trial that was
associated with greater efficacy compared with a 57 Gy schedule, although the 60 Gy schedule did
also show slightly greater toxicity.
The 2019 committee considered evidence from a large trial that showed a reduction in biochemical
failure (for example, local recurrence or distant metastases) associated with the use of low doserate brachytherapy plus external beam radiotherapy for people with high-risk localised prostate
cancer (now updated to the equivalent CPG 4 and 5 groups in the recommendation). As a result, the
committee amended the 2014 recommendation so it was not limited to high dose-rate
brachytherapy. The committee also agreed that as most centres do not offer both types of
brachytherapy, the advice gives clinicians a choice of either high dose-rate or low dose-rate
brachytherapy.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

How the recommendations might affect practice
As hypofractionated radiotherapy is already routinely used in practice (alongside other nonradiotherapy treatment options) for people with localised prostate cancer, these recommendations
are unlikely to have an impact on resources.
For brachytherapy (high dose-rate or low dose-rate), the committee agreed that only a small
number of people (typically those with CPG 4 and 5 prostate cancer) would currently have
brachytherapy, so the changes to the recommendations are unlikely to have a significant impact on
current practice.
Recommendations where intermediate risk was replaced with CPG 2 and 3 are likely to apply to a
smaller group of people. Therefore, the committee agreed that the changes were unlikely to result
in an increased use of resources.
Recommendations for high-risk prostate cancer were changed to be for CPG 4 and 5, but because
these groups are equivalent there would be no resource impact.
Return to recommendations

Docetaxel chemotherapy
Recommendations 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 and recommendation 1.5.6

Why the committee made the recommendations
There was good evidence that showed docetaxel improves overall survival, prostate cancer-specific
survival and clinical progression-free survival in people with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate
cancer who are starting long-term hormone therapy. The committee agreed these benefits
outweighed the potential harms of the treatment.
The evidence also showed docetaxel slows clinical progression in people with newly diagnosed
high-risk, non-metastatic cancer starting long-term hormone therapy. However, the evidence did
not show any extension of overall survival. Because of the known toxicities associated with
docetaxel treatment, the benefits and harms are more finely balanced in this population. As a
result, the committee identified this decision as being preference sensitive, and the person's values
and preferences are likely to be particularly important in their decision about the best course of
action for them.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

The committee also made a recommendation for research as it identified a gap in the evidence
related to there being no universal definition of locally advanced prostate cancer. A risk
stratification study will help identify patients at various levels of risks, and help tailor treatment
according to need.

How the recommendations might affect practice
Off-label use of docetaxel in people diagnosed with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer
is current practice, therefore the recommendation for the metastatic prostate cancer population is
likely to have no impact. However, this does not include high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer.
Therefore, the recommendation for this population could result in an increase in the number of
people with high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving docetaxel chemotherapy. Although
this could result in an increase in some shorter-term costs to the NHS, the economic evidence
showed a reduction in longer-term management costs, with the net effect that docetaxel is likely to
be cost-saving in the long term in this population and, once its benefits are also taken into account,
almost certain to represent a good use of NHS resources.
Return to recommendations 1.3.26 and 1.3.27
Return to recommendation 1.5.6

Follow up
Recommendations 1.3.45 to 1.3.50

Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee saw no new evidence to suggest any changes were needed to the recommendations
on follow-up strategies after radical treatment. The committee did not change the existing
recommendations that DRE should not be offered, as there was no new evidence to suggest it was
beneficial for people who were not on active surveillance.
Based on their expertise, the committee amended the recommendations on the location of the
follow up. The committee discussed different strategies already in use across the country such as
shared care, supported self-management and telephone-based follow up. Because it had not looked
at the specific evidence for these, it was unable to recommend a specific programme. The
committee agreed that the 2-year follow up recommended in the previous guideline was

with hospital-based services.
Given the lack of evidence, the committee also made a recommendation for research in this area.

How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee noted that follow-up strategies are variable across the country and the
recommendations will therefore have a varied resource impact across the country depending on
the level of follow up that is currently in place locally. Depending on the changes implemented,
there may be a large resource impact.

Bone-targeted therapies (bisphosphonates)
Recommendations 1.5.19 to 1.5.21

Why the committee made the recommendations
There was some evidence that showed zoledronic acid prolonged the time without skeletal-related
events in people with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer. However, the committee
could not make a stronger recommendation because the evidence did not show whether zoledronic
acid affects mortality in this population.
There was no new evidence that could affect the existing recommendation on the administration of
bisphosphonates for pain relief for people with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

How the recommendations might affect practice
There may be a small increase in the cost of hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer
treatment, but as zoledronic acid is now out of patent, this should limit the cost impact.

Prostate cancer: diagnosis and management (NG131)

Context
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and the second most common cancer in the UK.
In 2014, there were over 46,000 new diagnoses of prostate cancer, which accounts for 13% of all
new cancers diagnosed. About 1 in 8 people will get prostate cancer at some point in their life.
Prostate cancer can also affect trans women, as the prostate is usually conserved after
gender-confirming surgery, but it is not clear how common it is in this population.
More than 50% of prostate cancer diagnoses in the UK each year are in people aged 70 years and
over (2012), and the incidence rate is highest in people aged 90 years and over (2012 to 2014). Out
of every 10 prostate cancer cases, 4 are only diagnosed at a late stage in England (2014) and
Northern Ireland (2010 to 2014). Incidence rates are projected to rise by 12% between 2014 and
2035 in the UK to 233 cases per 100,000 in 2035.
A total of 84% of people aged 60 to 69 years at diagnosis in 2010/2011 are predicted to survive for
10 or more years after diagnosis. When diagnosed at the earliest stage, virtually all people with
prostate cancer survive 5 years or more: this is compared with less than a third of people surviving
5 years or more when diagnosed at the latest stage.
There were approximately 11,000 deaths from prostate cancer in 2014. Mortality rates from
prostate cancer are highest in people aged 90 years and over (2012 to 2014). Over the past decade,
mortality rates have decreased by more than 13% in the UK. Mortality rates are projected to fall by
16% between 2014 and 2035 to 48 deaths per 100,000 people in 2035.
People with an African family background are at higher risk of prostate cancer (lifetime risk of
approximately 1 in 4). Prostate cancer is inversely associated with deprivation, with a higher
incidence of cases found in more affluent areas of the UK.
Costs for the inpatient treatment of prostate cancer are predicted to rise to £320.6 million per year
in 2020 (from £276.9 million per year in 2010).
This guidance was updated in 2014 to include several treatments that have been licensed for the
management of hormone-relapsed metastatic prostate cancer since the publication of the original
NICE guideline in 2008.
Since the update in 2014, there have been changes in the way that prostate cancer is diagnosed and

treated. Advances in imaging technology, especially multiparametric MRI, have led to changes in
practice, and new evidence about some prostate cancer treatments means that some
recommendations needed to be updated.
Since the update in 2019 there has been new evidence on risk categorisation models for localised
and locally advanced prostate cancer. Therefore, recommendations on risk categorisation and
subsequent recommendations on treatments for different risk categories needed to be updated.

Update information
December 2021: We have reviewed the evidence and made a new recommendation on risk
stratification for people with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. This recommendation is marked
[2021]
[2021].
We have also made changes to other recommendations without an evidence review to reflect the
change in risk stratification model. These recommendations are marked [2008, amended 2021]
2021],
[2014, amended 2021] or [2019, amended 2021]
2021].
Recommendations marked [2008]
[2008], [2014] or [2019] last had an evidence review in 2008, 2014 or
2019 respectively. Changes made to recommendations in 2014 that did not come from a new
evidence review are marked [2008, amended 2014]
2014].
We added links to our interventional procedures guidance on focal therapy using high-intensity
focused ultrasound for localised prostate cancer and focal therapy using cryoablation for localised
prostate cancer (see recommendation 1.3.28).
May 2019: We reviewed the evidence and made new recommendations on diagnosis, treatment
and monitoring for people with prostate cancer.
Minor changes since publication
December 2021: Minor changes to redirect NICE Pathways links.
November 2020: We corrected the unit of measurement for PSA velocity to nanogram/ml/year in
recommendations 1.2.11 and 1.2.12.
